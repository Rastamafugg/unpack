**Chapter 1**

**Looking at the Basics**

BASIC09 is a computer language created for use with the NitrOS-9 operating
system. Along with standard BASIC language statements and functions, it includes
the most useful elements of the PASCAL computer language.

In brief, BASIC09’s advantages are:

```
Fast execution speed BASIC09 compiles procedure lines as you enter them.
When you finish a procedure, you can compile it further.
The result? Procedures that execute nearly as fast as
machine language.
```
```
Full feature editing The text editor features automatic line formatting,
search, search and change, global search, global search
and change, line renumbering, and much more. You can
move in and out of the editor quickly and easily.
```
```
Modular programming
functions
```
```
You can write small, easy-to-under-stand procedures,
then chain them to create sophisticated programs. You
can call one procedure from another, regardless of
whether the called procedure is in memory or on disk.
BASIC09/RUNB will handle a maximum of 128
procedures in its process space at once. (You can have
more than 128 if you LOAD/KILL them as needed.)
```
```
Interfacing to
NitrOS-
```
```
Both you and your procedures can take advantage of
almost any NitrOS-9 function from within BASIC09,
including the execution of disk management commands
and application programs.
```
```
Structured
programming
```
```
You can structure procedures more efficiently and
clearly by taking advantage of a variety of loop
commands, optional line numbering, and BASIC09’s
ability to call modules written in other computer
languages.
```
```
Memory saving Strings can be any length. For each operation, you can
select the most efficient of five available data types.
```

**_Basic09 Reference_**

```
features Compiled procedures use less space. You can save
several procedures into one file. String variables have a
maximum length of 32,767 bytes.
```
```
Complex data
structures
```
```
Combine any type of data into a single dimensioned data
structure that you can move, store, and assign easily and
quickly.
```
```
Sophisticated graphics BASIC09 has three levels of graphics. The high-
resolution graphics and text capabilities feature more
than seventy functions.
```
```
High speed, precision
math
```
```
BASIC09 has a full range of fast and accurate math and
transcendental capabilities including powers, roots,
trigonometry, logic, and boolean functions.
```
```
Simple and fast
debugging
```
```
BASIC09 provides superior debugging functions. It
checks syntax as you enter lines. It points to the location
of your errors and tells you what they are. You can stop
programs, enter the debugger, then continue execution.
Execution errors automatically put you in a debugging
mode where you can examine values, and step and trace
your way through faulty procedures.
```
**Using BASIC**

The Ease-Of-Use (EOU) NitrOS-9 hard drive images include all the Basic09-
related modules in the CMDS directory. It is a good idea to make sure you have a
copy of this disk image as a backup before you make any changes. (e.g. adding,
deleting, or modifying files, creating/deleting directories, etc.)

To use BASIC09, from any command line prompt type:

```
basic09[ENTER]
```
After a short pause, during which NitrOS-9 loads BASIC09 from the drive, the
screen displays the copyright notice and a new _prompt_ , like this:

**1 - 2**

##### BASIC

##### 6309 VERSION 01.01.

##### COPYRIGHT 1980 BY MOTOROLA INC.

##### AND MICROWARE SYSTEMS CORP.

##### REPRODUCED UNDER LICENSE

##### TO TANDY CORP.

##### ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.


```
Looking at the Basics | 1
```
The B: indicates that your computer is in the BASIC09 _command mode_. From the
command mode, you can issue instructions to the system executive to manipulate
procedures (programs). If you are using the 6809 version of NitrOS-9, the
copyright notice will reflect 6809. Note that running the 6809 version on a 6309
native mode system (like EOU/6309) can cause some errors. So make sure you are
using the one that came with your EOU image (don't worry, any programs you
write will run fine on both with no changes; it's only BASIC09 and RUNB
themselves that need to be the proper version).

**Requesting More Memory**

Unless you specify otherwise, BASIC09 automatically sets aside 8192 bytes of
memory (4096 bytes under Level One) as a workspace into which you can type or
load procedures. BASIC09 reserves approximately 1200 bytes (~1.2K) of the
workspace for internal use, leaving you with 6992 bytes for workspace (2896 bytes
under Level One).

There are two ways to set aside more memory for BASIC09 operations:

```
 You can reserve extra memory when you first enter BASIC09 by using the
NitrOS-9 memory size option. For instance, to reserve 18,176 bytes, enter
this command to initialize BASIC09:
```
```
basic09 #18k[ENTER]
 You can also request additional memory after loading BASIC09. At the
command prompt, B:, type:
```
```
mem 18000[ENTER]
```
```
This tells BASIC09 to set aside a total of 18,000 bytes of memory, if they
are available. (Level One will not have this much available memory.)
```
In both cases, because BASIC09 rounds the amount you request to the next
multiple of 256, the actual reserved memory is 18176 bytes.

```
Note: If your system does not have enough free memory to reserve the
amount you specify, the workspace size does not change.
```
You can also use the MEM command to reduce memory. However, BASIC09 does
not reduce the size of the workspace if doing so destroys resident procedures.

**Note:** BASIC09 allows a maximum of 40K in its workspace under Level Two (and
RUNB allows a maximum of 48K, assuming no external library/procedures are
being called as well that at least that aren't pre-merged). Under Level One it will

**_Basic09 Reference_**

depend on the size of the OS9Boot file since it shares 64K with the system (unlike
Level Two which keeps each process in its own 63.5K workspace).

**Writing Procedures**

BASIC09 is a _modular_ programming language. Several procedures can occupy
memory at the same time. Each procedure performs a particular function but can
also interact with others to form a sophisticated program.

To create or change procedures, enter the edit mode by typing either
edit[ENTER] or [E][ENTER] at the B: prompt. From now on, when directing
you to enter the edit mode, this manual uses the easier to type [E] command.

Each time you type a procedure line and press [ENTER], the editor checks for
common errors. This automatic checking lets you catch mistakes before you run
the program, saving you testing and rewriting time. You can even let the automatic
checking help you learn the rules of BASIC09. If you are not sure about a syntax,
go ahead and type it the way you think is correct. If you guess wrong, BASIC
shows where the error is and displays a message to tell what is wrong.

BASIC09’s use of modules lets you divide large and complex projects into smaller,
easily manageable sections. Not only are the smaller procedures easier to write and
understand, they are also easier to test. As well, because BASIC09 lets you _call_
procedures that are outside the _workspace_ (the computer’s memory where you
write and edit procedures), you can accumulate libraries of procedures to
incorporate into future programs.


```
Looking at the Basics | 1
```
You can work on a program’s procedures either individually or as a group. For
example, to work on the procedures as a group, save your workspace procedures
into a single disk file. When you subsequently load the file, BASIC
automatically loads all of the procedures.

**Modules of Other Languages**

BASIC09 can incorporate procedures from other languages, such as Pascal, C, or
assembly language. Several users can then share the procedures.

**Executing Procedures**

You execute or _run_ procedures from the command mode. When you enter a
procedure, BASIC09 compiles it. This means that a procedure is ready for
execution as soon as you exit the edit mode. For instance, if you create a procedure
named Greeting, you can execute it by typing from the command mode:

```
run greeting[ENTER]
```
**Leaving BASIC**

There are two ways you can exit from BASIC09:

```
 At the B: prompt, type:
```
```
bye[ENTER]
 Or, at the B: prompt, press [CTRL][BREAK].
```
When you use either method, the NitrOS-9 prompt appears immediately indicating
that the operating system is waiting for a command.

```
Note: When you exit BASIC09, you lose all procedures residing in the
workspace. Be sure to save them on disk before leaving BASIC09.
```
**The Keyboard and BASIC**

You can use some keys and _key sequences_ to produce special characters and to
accomplish special BASIC09 functions. You initiate a key sequence by pressing
one key and holding it down while pressing a second key. The following list
summarizes your keyboard’s special functions:

```
[ALT] Produces graphic characters. Press [ALT] char where
char is a keyboard character.
```
```
[CTRL] A control key that you use with other keys. (See
```

**_Basic09 Reference_**

below.)
```
```
[BREAK] or
[CTRL][E]
```
```

```
```
[CTRL][.] Produces a right brace (}).
```
```
[CTRL][#] Produces a tilde (~).
```
```
[CTRL][/] Produces a backslash (\).
```
```
[CTRL][BREAK] Performs an ESCAPE function and sends an end-of-
file message to a program receiving keyboard input.
To be recognized, [CTRL][BREAK] must be the first
thing typed on a line.
```
```
[SHIFT][BREAK] Stops execution of a program and causes BASIC09 to

**Chapter 2**

**Sample Session**

Although BASIC09 has several functions or modes, they all work together to make
programming as simple as possible. The easiest way to learn how BASIC09 and its
functions operate is to write and run a program. This chapter provides sample
statements and instructions to help you learn how to use BASIC09.

To create and execute a program:

1. Load BASIC09 and enter the edit mode.
2. Type the BASIC program.
3. Enter the system mode and test the program’s execution.
4. Debug the program. (Correct any programming errors.)
5. Save the completed program on disk.
6. Load the program into memory and use it.

To begin the program, execute BASIC09. To be sure you have enough room in
which to work, reserve a workspace of 10,000 bytes by typing:

basic09 #10k[ENTER]
The BASIC09 system mode prompt, B:, appears after the copyright message. In
the system mode, you can do such things as save and load procedures, change
workspace size, and rename and delete procedures.

**Creating a Procedure**

To write procedures, you must be in the edit mode. You get there by typing:

e[ENTER]
This causes the screen prompt to change to E:, and the screen displays:

PROCEDURE Program
Because you didn’t give a program name when you entered e, BASIC09 selects the
name Program for you. Now, you must write the code to make Program do
something.


**_Basic09 Reference_**

**Commands and Statements**

There are two responses you can give at the edit mode prompt. You can type an
edit command, or you can type a _statement_. A statement is a text version of an
instruction that BASIC09 will execute. It consists of a _keyword_ , an _expression_ , or a
combination of _keywords_ and _expressions_. If you type a statement, **you must type
a space as the first character of the line.** If you type an edit command, do **not**
precede it with a space. To make listings easier to read, this manual uses the
symbol c to indicate spaces before every statement. It also uses the c symbol in
some statements to indicate the correct number of spaces needed. Whenever you
see a space or a c symbol in a procedure you are typing, press the spacebar.

**NOTE:** You may want to edit your source code files using one of the text editors
found on the NitrOS-9 EOU hard disk. You can run the editor in a different
window, editing your source as needed, then save the changes, followed by
reloading the source file into BASIC09.

To type the procedure in this chapter, begin each line at the E: prompt. After typing
a line, check it for mistakes. If you make a mistake, use [LEFT ARROW] to move
the cursor back. Correct the mistake. Then, type the remaining portion of the line.
If there are no mistakes, press [ENTER].

BASIC09 checks each line when you press [ENTER]. If you make a mistake in
syntax or form, BASIC09 displays an error message. An arrow points to the place
in the program line where the error occurred, and a message number indicates the
type of error. Refer to Appendix A for an explanation of the error codes.

If, after you enter a line, you find that you made a mistake, type d[ENTER] to
delete the line. Then, retype the line. Later, the manual tells you how to change text
in existing lines.

The following program helps you do a bit of arithmetic. To get a feel for
BASIC09, type and execute the program as directed. Remember, when you see a
space or c, press the spacebar.

```

```
**Executing a Procedure**

To execute the procedure, quit edit mode by typing q [ENTER]. The compiler
further processes your procedure, and the B: prompt reappears. To execute the
procedure type:

```
run[ENTER]
```
Type in numbers when asked, and the procedure produces their sum. If you want to
save the program on disk, the next chapter tells you how. Chapter 4 introduces
several other edit mode commands to search, display, insert, and change statements
and text.


**Chapter 3**

**The System Mode**

At the B: prompt, you can enter system commands in either upper- or lowercase
letters. Some commands operate on the procedures in the workspace. Others
provide functions independent of any procedures. Following is a list of all system
commands and their purposes.

**Command Function**

```
$ Calls the shell command interpreter to execute a NitrOS-
command.
```
```
BYE or
[CTRL]
[BREAK]
```
```
Returns you to the NitrOS-9 system or to the program that
called BASIC09. NOTE: Any procedures that you have edited
will be abandoned. If you wish to save your work, make sure to
SAVE your procedures first!
```
```
CHD Changes the current NitrOS-9 data directory.
```
```
CHX Changes the current NitrOS-9 execution directory.
```
```
[ENTER] or
DIR
```
```
Displays the name, size, and variable storage requirement of
each procedure in the workspace.
```
```
EDIT or E Enters the procedure editor-compiler mode.
```
```
KILL Erases one or more procedures from the workspace.
```
```
LIST Displays a formatted listing of one or more procedures.
```
```
LOAD Loads all procedures from a disk file into the workspace.
```
```
MEM Displays in bytes the current workspace size, or reserves a
specified amount of memory for the workspace.
```
```
PACK Condenses (compiles) one or more procedures. NOTE: Unless
you SAVE the procedures before PACKing, you will lose the
changes you made (or the entire source if you haven't saved it
before)!
```
```
RENAME Changes a procedure’s name.
```

**_Basic09 Reference_**

```
RUN Causes a procedure in the workspace to execute.
```
```
SAVE Writes one or more procedures to disk.
```
**Renaming Procedures**

BASIC09’s RENAME function is important for two reasons: First, it lets you load
into the workspace procedures that have the same name. After you rename the
workspace procedure you can load the second file. Second, if you let BASIC09 use
the default procedure name, "Program", you can rename the procedure before
saving it to disk. By doing this you avoid writing over—and destroying—an
existing procedure file. When naming procedures, do not use extension names (e.g.
_.prog_ ) as BASIC09 will strip it off if you try to LOAD a procedure with a "." in
the module name. Using extension names in the files you save (such as _.b09_ ) are
acceptable.

To change the name of the procedure you created in the previous program from
"Program" to "add", type:

```
rename program add[ENTER]
```
**Listing Procedure Names**

You can use the DIR command to see if RENAME worked properly. DIR list the
names and sizes of all procedures in memory. Because programmers use this
command frequently, the system recognizes a shorthand call. Instead of typing
dir[ENTER] you only need to press [ENTER]. This displays a table of the
procedures in the following format:

```
Name Proc-Size Data-Size
*add 182 32
add1 217 42
add2 218 42
2198 free
```
_Proc-Size_ refers to the number of memory bytes required for the procedure. _Data-
Size_ refers to the number of memory bytes required for the procedure’s variables
and data structures. The asterisk indicates the current procedure. System
commands act on the current procedure unless you indicate otherwise.

The last line of the DIR display tells you how many free bytes of memory remain
in the BASIC09 workspace.


```
The System Mode | 3
```
**Listing Procedures**

You can use the LIST command to view procedure lines. To display the current
procedure, type:

```
list[ENTER]
```
For example, this is a listing for a procedure named Alpha:

```
PROCEDURE Alpha
0000 DIM A:STRING
0007 DIM T:INTEGER
000E
000F PRINT "Here is the alphabet backwards:"
0032 PRINT
0034 FOR T=90 TO 65 STEP -1
004A PRINT CHR$(T);
0051 PRINT " ";
0057 NEXT T
0062 PRINT
0064 PRINT
0066 END
```
You can list multiple procedures to the screen using the following methods:

```
list*[ENTER] Lists all procedures in the workspace to the screen
list proc1,proc2,proc3[ENTER] Lists proc1, proc2, and
proc3 to the screen
```
Each procedure line is known as an instruction. When you list a BASIC09
procedure, the system precedes each instruction with a _relative storage address_.
The relative address of the first instruction is always 0, and this marks the
beginning of the procedure. In the original BASIC09 reference, the memory
allocation definition for each instruction is _storage units_. One storage unit in
BASIC09 is a _byte_. In the previous example, the second instruction begins 8 bytes
from the beginning, and the first instruction is 7 bytes long (00-06 hexadecimal).
The third instruction begins 15 bytes from the beginning and shows the second
instruction is also 7 bytes long (07-0D hexadecimal). Upon entering an instruction,
BASIC09 compiles it, and the length of the source text does not reflect the size of
the instruction.

When an error occurs, these addresses provide a way for the compiler to let you
know where the error occurred. They are known as I-Code, or Intermediate Code,
addresses.


**_Basic09 Reference_**

Because BASIC09 compiles programs into I-Code, it must _disassemble_ them
before it can display them on the screen. This means the lines might not look
exactly as typed. For instance, BASIC09 converts lowercase _keywords_ (command
names) to uppercase. BASIC09 also eliminates some spaces. If your program uses
control statements, such as IF/THEN, FOR/NEXT or LOOP/ENDLOOP, the lines
in these decision making or looping structures are indented as shown in the Alpha
example. Regardless of the appearance of your listed procedures, they execute
correctly if you type their commands correctly.

**Listing Procedures to a File**

There might be times when you want to send a formatted procedure listing,
including I-Code addresses, directly to a file. You can do this using NitrOS-9’s
redirection symbol, >. To save the Alpha procedure to a file named Alpha.list in
the current data directory, type:

```
list alpha >alpha.list[ENTER]
```
If you have several procedures in the workspace and want to list more than one to a
disk file, separate the procedure names with commas, like this:

```
list alpha_one,alpha_two,alpha_three >
alpha.all[ENTER]
```
In both of the preceding cases, the system creates the Alpha.list and Alpha.all files
and stores the specified listings in them. If you use a filename that already exists,
BASIC09 displays the prompt:

```
Rewrite?:
```
If you press [Y], the system destroys the original file and overwrites it with the
new listing. If you press [N] the LIST process terminates.

If you wish to list a procedure, or a group of procedures, to a file that is not in the
current data directory, be sure to specify the complete pathlist, such as:

```
list alpha > /d1/programs/alpha.rev[ENTER]
```
**Listing Procedures to a Printer**

In the same manner as you list procedures to a disk file, you can list one or more
procedures to your printer. Make certain your printer is connected and turned on,
then again use the redirection symbol, but this time specify the printer device, like
this:

```
list alpha > /p[ENTER]
```

```
The System Mode | 3
```
Or:

```
list alpha_one,alpha_two,alpha_three > /p[ENTER]
```
**Using a Wildcard**

Using the NitrOS-9 wildcard, *, you can list all procedures in the workspace. For
instance, if the procedures Alpha_one, Alpha_two, and Alpha_three exist, list them
to the screen by typing:

```
list*[ENTER]
```
Send the list to a file by typing:

```
list* alpha.all[ENTER]
```
Or send the list to your printer by typing:

```
list* /p[ENTER]
Note: When you use the wildcard, the name of the file or device to
receive the listing immediately follows the LIST* command. Do not
use the redirection symbol.
```
**Saving Procedures**

You can save one or more procedures to disk using the SAVE command. Unlike
LIST, SAVE does not include relative addresses. However, the syntaxes for the
LIST and SAVE commands are identical. To save the procedure Alpha to the
current data directory, type:

```
save alpha alpha.bak[ENTER]
```
If Alpha is the current procedure, you can save it in a file named Alpha by typing
save[ENTER].

To save all of the procedures in the workspace to a file named All.programs in the
current data directory, type:

```
save* All.programs[ENTER]
```
As with LIST, to save one or more procedures in a file that is not in the current
data directory, make sure you specify a complete pathlist.

To save all of the files in the workspace to a disk file with the same name as the
current procedure, type save*[ENTER].

If the disk file you specify does not exist, BASIC09 creates it. If it does exist, the
system displays the prompt:

```
Rewrite?:
```

**_Basic09 Reference_**

Press [Y] to write over the old file with the specified file. The old file is
destroyed.

Press [N] to terminate the SAVE operation.

**Loading Procedures**

To load a saved procedure back into BASIC09’s workspace, use the LOAD
command and specify the appropriate pathlist. For instance, if your current
directory is still the directory containing Alpha.bak, load the procedure by typing:

```
load alpha.bak[ENTER]
```
To load Alpha.bak from the PROGRAMS directory on Drive /D1, type:

```
load /d1/programs/alpha.bak[ENTER]
```
You can run and edit a loaded procedure in exactly the same manner as you would
a procedure you created.

You can load any number of procedures into the workspace (up to a maximum of
128) as long as your computer has sufficient memory. However, be careful that
you do not load a procedure with the same name as a procedure already existing in
the workspace. If you do, the new procedure overwrites (destroys) the original
procedure. You can rename workspace procedures to avoid this problem.

**Deleting Procedures from the Workspace**

You can clear the workspace of one or more procedures using the KILL command.
For instance, to remove Alpha from the workspace, type:

```
kill alpha[ENTER]
```
To remove more than one procedure from the workspace, separate the procedure
names with commas. To delete Alpha_1 and Alpha_2, type:

```
kill alpha_1,alpha_2[ENTER]
```
To clear the entire workspace, regardless of the number of procedures it contains,
use the BASIC09 wildcard, *. Type:

```
kill*[ENTER]
```
**Changing Directories**

You change working directories in BASIC09 and NitrOS-9 in the same manner, by
using the CHD and CHX commands. CHD changes the working directory and
CHX changes the execution directory.


```
The System Mode | 3
```
BASIC09 saves files in, or loads files from, the data directory, unless you specify
differently in the command pathlist. It stores PACKed procedures in, or loads
PACKed procedures from, the execution directory, unless you specify differently
in the command pathlist.

Also, if you want to access NitrOS-9 commands from BASIC09, the system first
looks for the commands in memory. If they are not there, it looks for them in the
execution directory, unless you specify differently.

If your data directory is the ROOT directory, and you wish to change to a directory
named PROGRAMS that is a subdirectory of the ROOT directory, type the
following command from the command mode B: prompt:

```
chd programs[ENTER]
```
If your current execution directory is the system’s CMDS directory, and you want
to change to a CMDS directory in the subdirectory BASIC, type:

```
chx basic/cmds[ENTER]
```
Whenever you change to a directory other than an immediate subdirectory, specify
a complete pathlist.

**Executing NitrOS-9 Commands**

BASIC09 lets you use NitrOS-9 commands at any time from the system mode. To
do so, precede the command with a dollar sign ($). For instance, to look at the
current data directory, type:

```
$dir[ENTER]
```
To view the current execution directory, type:

```
$dir -x[ENTER]
```
All NitrOS-9 commands are available, and you can copy files, format diskettes, list
files, or use any other functions from the system mode. The only restriction is that
your computer must have enough free memory to handle the command you call. If
you find that there is not enough memory, try using the MEM command to reduce
reserved memory. Then, try the command again.

If you plan on executing multiple NitrOS-9 commands in a row, you can type '$' by
itself to spawn a child shell, where you can run whichever commands you need to.
To return to BASIC09, type 'ex' at the Shell prompt.


**_Basic09 Reference_**

**CAUTION:** Take care when using NitrOS9 commands run from BASIC09. Some
commands will change the screen mode, colors, etc. that may make BASIC09
unreadable when the called command exits. Generic command line style
commands should be fine.

**Auto-Execute Procedures**

The BASIC09 compiler makes two passes through the procedures you write. When
you edit the procedure, the compiler performs an initial compilation, checking for
any syntax errors. When you leave the edit mode, the system compiles the
procedure a second time and checks for any programming errors (such as
incomplete loop structures, etc.). With the PACK command, you can further
compile your procedures so that they are smaller and execute even faster.

```
NOTE: Redirection does not work when using pack* (packing all
procedures).
```
PACK causes an extra compiler pass that removes names, line numbers, and non-
executable statements. **Before packing a procedure, be sure you save it. Unless
you do so, you cannot make further changes to the procedure.**

Once you pack a file, you cannot list or edit the packed version. However, if you
save the procedure to disk before packing, you can still list and edit the original
file, then pack it again.

When you save a packed procedure on disk, BASIC09 does not normally store it in
the data directory. Because the procedure is now _executable_ , the system stores it in
the current execution directory.

For instance, to convert Alpha to a packed procedure in the execution directory,
type:

```
pack Alpha[ENTER]
```
If you want to save a packed procedure under a different filename, use the NitrOS-
9 redirection symbol:

```
pack Alpha > backwards[ENTER]
```
After packing a procedure, you can delete it from the workspace. If you then run it,
BASIC09 automatically loads the file from disk and executes it.


```
The System Mode | 3
```
The following is a sequence of commands that demonstrate packing and executing
a procedure named Alpha.

```
pack Alpha[ENTER] packs the procedure and stores it in the
execution directory.
kill Alpha[ENTER] deletes the procedure from the workspace.
run Alpha[ENTER] loads the file into memory outside the
workspace and executes it.
kill Alpha[ENTER] deletes the module from memory.
```
You do not need to kill the file immediately after execution, but until you do, the
file reduces available memory.


**Chapter 4**

**The Edit Mode**

You briefly used the BASIC09 built-in editor to create the Add procedure in
Chapter 2. In addition to the features you learned there, the editor has other
important functions.

Although you can use any text editor or word processor to write BASIC09
procedures, the BASIC09 editor offers two handy features:

```
 It is both string and line number oriented. You can search for strings of
characters, and replace them, and you can reference text with optional line
numbers.
 It interfaces with the compiler and decompiler. This feature lets BASIC09
check continuously for syntax errors and enables you to use procedures that
conserve memory.
```
**Edit Commands**

```
Command Function
```
```
[ENTER] Moves the edit pointer to the next line. Causes a command to

procedure from the current line until the end of the
procedure. To search all occurrences in the procedure, use -
* to move the edit pointer to the top of the procedure.
```
**Using the Editor**

The easiest way to understand the edit commands is to use them. The following
sections show you the functions of BASIC09 edit mode.


**_Basic09 Reference_**

The manual uses line numbers in the following procedure to acquaint you with all
of the functions of the editor. Remember, however, that line numbers are not
required with BASIC09. Procedures and programs without line numbers are
shorter, faster and easier to read.

First, you need a procedure to work with. Position yourself in the system mode.
Then, type this line:

```
e Prose[ENTER]
```
Now, type the following. (Remember, the c represents a space.)

```
c100 DIM PHRASES(30):STRING
c120 FOR T=1 TO 30
c130 READ PHRASES(T)
c140 NEXT T
c160 PRINT
c170 FIRST=RND(10)
c180 SECOND=RND(9)+11
c190 THIRD=RND(9)+21
c200 PRINT PHRASES(FIRST);
c210 PRINT PHRASES(SECOND);
c220 PRINT PHRASES(THIRD);
c240 PRINT
c300 DATA "Lovec","An orangec","Humanityc","A
kissc"
c310 DATA "A dark cloudc","A goose featherc","A
popsiclec"
c320 DATA "Home cookingc","Cold pizzac","Rock n’
Rollc"
c330 DATA "is charming likec","makes me dream
ofc"
c340 DATA "is as sticky asc","can ooze
likec","smells likec"
c350 DATA "can be as tough to forget asc","can
hurt likec"
c360 DATA "can be as cynical asc","makes a mockery
ofc"
c370 DATA "drives me as crazy asc"
c380 DATA "a sticky lollipop.","a web of
intrigue."
```

```
The Edit Mode | 4
c390 DATA "castor oil.","a chocolate bath.","a
broken toe."
c400 DATA "honey and things.","personal
defeat.","a wet diaper."
c410 DATA "strange happenings.","a pennyless
purse."
```
When you finish typing the procedure, type q[ENTER] to return to the system
mode. Now you can test the program by typing either:

run[ENTER]
or
run prose[ENTER]

After trying the procedure, return to the edit mode by typing e[ENTER].

After displaying the procedure’s name, the editor displays line 100 preceded by an
asterisk. The asterisk lets you know which line is the _current line_ (or the line at
which the edit pointer is located.)

**Searching Through a Procedure**

You can examine a procedure in three ways:

```
 Press [ENTER] to display the procedure one line at a time.
 Skip through the procedure to a particular line.
 List part or all of the procedure to the screen.
```
When you use either of the first two methods, the line you select to display
becomes your current line. When you use the third method, the current line does
not change.

**Using [ENTER]**

If you are still positioned at line 100, but want to examine the first line of data, line
300, press [ENTER] 12 times to move down.

**Using the Plus Sign to Move Forward**

Another method of moving to a specific line is to type a plus sign followed by the
number of lines you need to advance to get there. Positioned at line 100, you can
type:

```
+12[ENTER]
```

**_Basic09 Reference_**

Whether you press [ENTER] or use the plus sign, the last line displayed is now
your current line.

**Accessing a Line Using the Line Number**

The third way to move to a particular line is to type the line number, followed by
[ENTER]. For instance, to jump back to line 100, type:

```
100[ENTER]
```
The editor displays line 100 and makes it your current line.

**Using the Minus Sign to Move Backward**

In the same manner that you move forward in the procedure using the plus sign,
you can move backward using the minus sign, or hyphen.

Type 300[ENTER] to return to line 300. To display line 240 and make it your
current line, type:

```
-[ENTER]
```
To display line 190 and make it your current line, type:

```
-4[ENTER]
```
**The Global Symbol**

The BASIC09 editor also makes use of the asterisk as a global symbol. For
instance, following a command with an asterisk causes that command to affect the
entire procedure.

This feature allows you to move quickly to the beginning and end of the procedure.
To return to line l00, the first line, type:

```
-*[ENTER]
```
To move to the end of the procedure, past all the numbered lines, type:

```
+*[ENTER]
```
**Using List**

The LIST command lets you select one or more lines for display on your screen.
To see this, make the first line your current line, then type:

```
l[ENTER]
```
To list one or more lines, type the LIST command followed by the number of lines
you want displayed. For instance, typing l5[ENTER] causes the current line and


```
The Edit Mode | 4
```
four others to appear on the screen, as shown in the following sequence of
commands and the resulting display:

```
-*[ENTER]
l5[ENTER]
0000 100 DIM PHRASES(30):STRING
000F 120 FOR T=1 TO 30
0024 130 READ PHRASES(T)
0031 140 NEXT T
003F 160 PRINT
```
You can also use LIST with the BASIC09 global symbol, *. Typing an asterisk
after the LIST command produces a listing of the entire procedure.

**Deleting Lines**

Earlier, the manual showed that you can delete the current line by typing
d[ENTER]. Because this is such a simple process, be sure you don’t do it by
accident. Removing the wrong line, or too many lines, is very frustrating in a
complex procedure.

You can also remove a group of lines from a procedure by typing d, followed by
the number of lines you want to delete. This command deletes the current line and
specified following lines. Again, be careful.

You can remove all of the lines in a procedure by using the global symbol, *.
Typing d*[ENTER] erases all procedure text. However, the procedure name still
resides in the workspace. To delete an entire procedure, including the name, use
the KILL command from the system mode.

If you decide you don’t like the nouns used in the DATA lines of the Prose
procedure, erase all the DATA lines containing nouns (lines 300-320) and replace
them. To do so, make line 300 your current line by typing:

```
300[ENTER]
```
Then type:

```
d[ENTER]
```
Line 300 disappears and line 310 takes its place as the current line. To finish
deleting lines 310 and 320, simply type d[ENTER] two more times.


**_Basic09 Reference_**

Alternatively, another method of deleting the DATA lines 300-320 uses only one
command. To delete lines 300 through 320, follow the DELETE command with
the number of lines you want to remove—in this case, three:

```
d3[ENTER]
```
Lines 300, 310, and 320 disappear. Line 330 becomes the current line. Move back
a line to make sure the deletions worked. The line numbers now skip from 240 to
330.

Now you need new nouns for the procedure. Type them in the same style as the old
lines, such as:

```
c300 DATA "A telephonec","A ticklec","A girlc","A boyc"
c310 DATA "Bad luckc","Moneyc","A bad betc","A lumpy
bedc"
c320 DATA "A deep thoughtc","Sunlightc"
```
Save a copy of your procedure to disk by exiting the editor and using the SAVE
command. Then return to the edit mode and try the global delete by typing:

```
d*[ENTER]
```
**Changing Text**

Using CHANGE tells the editor to search for existing text and replace it with new
text. CHANGE, like DELETE, can easily cause unwanted results if you are not
careful. CHANGE will change the desired text from the current instruction.
CHANGE-all will change from the current instruction to the end of the procedure
being edited.

The CHANGE command requires that you use _delimiters_ to separate the command
from the search text, and to separate the search text from the new text. You can
select from any of the following characters for a delimiter, as long as it does not
appear in either the search text or the new text:

```
!#%^&()-+={}[]"‘<>,.?/\|
```
Do not use the global symbol (*) for search and replace operations. This manual
uses a (/) as the CHANGE delimiter.

The following steps outline the correct use of CHANGE:

1. Position the editor either before or on the line in which you want to make a
    change.
2. Type c (for CHANGE). Do not use a preceding space.


```
The Edit Mode | 4
```
3. Type a delimiter character, such as /.
4. Type the characters to be changed, following them with the delimiter.
5. Type the new text, followed by the delimiter, closing delimiter optional. (Do
    not confuse this with the NitrOS-9 edit command, where the closing
    delimiter is required.)
6. Press [ENTER].

```
Note: It is a good idea to turn on NitrOS-9’s upper- and lowercase function
before attempting change or search operations. If you do not, you cannot tell
whether the text you want to find is upper- or lowercase, or some combination
of the two. If you type the wrong case, the change or search fails.
```
In case you didn’t notice when typing the procedure, line 410 contains an
incorrectly spelled word, pennyless. To correct this error, type the following:

```
c/pennyless/penniless/[ENTER]
```
Immediately, the editor displays line 410, with pennyless changed to penniless.

Suppose you decide to change the number of sentence combinations available in
Prose. The procedure now has 30 data entries. If you add five subjects, five verb
phrases, and five objects, the procedure also needs other changes (for instance, the
DIM statement in line 100, the loop size in line 120, and the RND statements in
lines 170 through 190).

A quick way to change the number 30 in lines 100 and 120 is to use CHANGE’s
global function. To change all occurrences of 30 to 45, position the editor at line
100, and type:

```
C*/30/45/[ENTER]
```
Use the CHANGE and global CHANGE functions to adjust the RND statements in
lines 170, 180, and 190.

As well as making changes, you can use the CHANGE command to quickly delete
portions of text within a line. To do this, type delimiters without new text, in this
fashion:

```
C/cfeather//[ENTER]
```
This command changes the text "A goose feather" in line 310 to "A
goose". The closing delimiter in this instance is not optional.


**_Basic09 Reference_**

**Searching for Text**

The editor’s SEARCH command, S, works in the same manner as the CHANGE
command. However, SEARCH only requires you specify a block of text to find.
SEARCH will search for the desired text from the current instruction. SEARCH-all
will search from the current instruction to the end of the procedure being edited.

With SEARCH, you use delimiters to enclose the text to find. To test the function,
position the editor at the beginning of text by typing:

```
-*[ENTER]
```
Now, search for the word phrases, by typing:

```
s/phrases/[ENTER] (closing delimiter optional)
```
The screen displays:

```
*0000 100 DIM phrases(30):STRING
```
To find all occurrences of phrases throughout the procedure, use the global
symbol. Type:

```
s*/phrases/[ENTER]
```
**Renumbering Lines**

The RENUMBER command, R, renumbers all numbered lines and all references to
numbered lines. You can give RENUMBER either one or two parameters. The first
is the beginning line number. The second is the increment you want. The default
increment is 10.

For instance, the Prose procedure line numbers skip from line 100 to line 120. You
can renumber the entire procedure by moving the editor to line 100, and then
typing:

```
r 10[ENTER]
```
To change the numbering to increments of 5, beginning at line 100, type:

```
r 100,5[ENTER]
```
You can also change line numbering in portions of the procedure. To do this move
the editor to the line where you want the new numbering to begin. Then, type in
the new parameters. To renumber line 100 as line 200 and continue with
increments of 10, position the editor at line 100. Then type:

```
r 200,10[ENTER]
```

```
The Edit Mode | 4
```
If you are not positioned at the first line of the a procedure, but you wish to
renumber all lines, you can use the global symbol to do the job. From anywhere in
the procedure, type:

```
r* 100,10[ENTER]
```
This renumbers the entire procedure and increments of 10.

**Adding Lines**

There are two ways to add new lines to a procedure. You can:

```
 Position the editor one line below the position for the new line. Then type
the new line and press [ENTER]. When inserting lines without numbers, Be
sure to type a space as the first character of the line tell the editor that the
following text is a new procedure line.
 Type a new line, giving it a line number that falls between two existing line
numbers.
```
The following procedure adds more choices to the Prose program. It also adds a
new feature that lets you press [ENTER] for additional output, rather than having
to rerun the procedure. Use the information presented in this section to help you
insert the new lines into your program. Because you must change some lines, as
well as add lines, the following listing includes the entire procedure.

Referring to the original Prose listing, the lines to change are: 100, 120, 170, 180,
and 190.

The lines to add are: 110, 150, 230, 250, 260, 270, 305, 325, 372, 374, 376, 420,
430.

**The Next Step**

Even the best programmers make mistakes—a lot of them. BASIC09 provides a
way to catch programming mistakes quickly and correct them. The next chapter
tells you about BASIC09’s powerful debugging functions.


**Chapter 5**

**The Debug Mode**

The term _debug_ refers to the process of finding programming errors and correcting
them. BASIC09’s debugging features include _symbolic_ debugging capabilities that
let you examine variable values and test and manipulate procedures.

With debug you can:

```
 Examine and change variables.
 Trace procedure execution. Debug lets you execute procedures and watch
them run in slow motion.
 Pause procedure execution.
 Resume procedure execution.
 Set procedure breakpoints that automatically switch to the debug mode.
 Select and use degrees or radians for trigonometric functions.
 Perform calculations.
 Call NitrOS-9 system commands.
```
**Entering the Debug Mode**

You enter Debug:

```
 Automatically, whenever an error occurs during the execution of a procedure
(unless you have included an ON ERROR GOTO statement to handle the
error).
 Automatically, when a procedure executes a PAUSE statement.
 When you press [CTRL][C] during the execution of a procedure.
```
You can tell when BASIC09 enters the Debug mode by the appearance of the D:
prompt. When you see D:, followed by the cursor, Debug is waiting for your
command.

The following is a reference of all of the Debug commands and what they
accomplish:


**_Basic09 Reference_**

```
Command Function
```
```
$ Calls NitrOS-9’s command shell interpreter to run a program
or an NitrOS-9 command. From the Debug prompt, type $,
followed by the name of the program or command you want
to execute.
```
```
Example: $list procedure_one[ENTER]
```
```
BREAK Sets a breakpoint immediately before the specified
procedure. Use this command to re-enter Debug when one
procedure calls another.
```
```
If you have three procedures that call each other—Proc1,
Proc2, and Proc3—and Proc3 doesn’t seem to pass the
correct values to Proc2 when it returns, set a breakpoint at
Proc2. This causes BASIC09 to enter Debug before re-
entering Proc2. You can then check your variable values.
```
```
You use one breakpoint for each active procedure. Debug
removes breakpoints immediately after encountering them.
```
```
A procedure must run before you can set a breakpoint in it.
Use BREAK to stop execution when a called procedure
returns to a procedure previously executed.
```
```
Example: break proc2[ENTER]
```
```
CONT Causes procedure execution to continue.
```
```
Example: cont[ENTER]
```
```
DEG/RAD Selects either degrees or radians as the unit of measurement
for trigonometric functions. DEG and RAD affect only the
current procedure.
```
```
Examples: deg[ENTER]
rad[ENTER]
```

```
The Debug Mode | 5
```
**Command Function**

**DIR** Displays the name, size, and variable storage requirements
for each procedure in the workspace. The current working
procedure has an asterisk before its name. All packed
procedures have a dash before their names. DIR also shows
the available memory in the workspace.

```
If you provide a pathlist, DIR sends its data to the specified
file.
```
```
Examples: dir[ENTER]
dir procedures[ENTER]
```
**Q** Terminates execution of the procedure, closes any open
paths, and exits to the System mode.

```
Example: q[ENTER]
```
**LET** Assigns a new value to a variable. You must specify variable
names that are already initialized by your program. In the
Debug mode, You cannot use LET to copy one array to
another array as you can in BASIC procedures.

```
Examples: let a := 0[ENTER]
let fruit := "oranges"[ENTER]
```
**LIST** Displays a source listing of the suspended procedure. The
display is formatted and contains I-code addresses. An
asterisk appears to the left of the last executed statement.

```
Example: list[ENTER]
```
**PRINT** Displays the values of variables used in the suspended
procedure. You cannot introduce new variable names in the
Debug mode, and you cannot display array or complex
structures (although you can display individual array
elements). The question mark short form of PRINT does not
work; the whole word must be typed.


**_Basic09 Reference_**

```
Command Function
```
```
You can print multiple variables at once in a single PRINT
by separating them by commas (spaces them apart by 16
characters) or semi-colons (runs them together with no
spaces).
```
```
Example: print fruit[ENTER]
```
```
STATE Lists the nesting order of active procedures. STATE displays
the highest-level procedure at the bottom of the calling list.
The lowest-level procedure is the suspended procedure.
```
```
Example: state[ENTER]
```
```
STEP Causes execution of the suspended procedure in specified
increments. For example, typing step 5[ENTER] execute
the equivalent of the next five statements. If you enter STEP
without a increment value, the step rate is 1.
```
```
Using step with the trace function lets you observe the source
lines as they execute.
```
```
Because compiled I-Code contains actual statement memory
addresses, the top or bottom statements of loop structures
execute only once. For example, in FOR/NEXT loops, FOR
executes once, and the statement following FOR appears to
be the top of the loop.
```
```
TRON/TROFF Turns on or turns off the trace function. Trace on (TRON)
causes the system to reconstruct the compiled code of each
statement line into source code. Debug displays the source
code before the statement is executed. If the statement causes
the evaluation of one or more expressions, Debug displays
each result following the statement. The result is preceded by
an equal sign.
```
```
The trace function is local to the current procedure. If the
suspended procedure calls another procedure, Debug
suspends the trace function until control returns to the
original procedure. However, once you turn on trace for a
procedure, it continues in effect until you turn it off. This
means that if you turn trace on in a called procedure, and
```

```
The Debug Mode | 5
```
```
another procedure subsequently calls it, trace continues to
display the called procedure’s operations.
```
```
Examples: tron[ENTER]
troff[ENTER]
```
**When Things Go Wrong**

Programming errors show up in two ways. Either your procedure produces
incorrect results, or it terminates prematurely.

In the first instance, you can stop your procedure and enter Debug by pressing
[CTRL][C].

However, sometimes your program executes too quickly to allow you to stop it at
the appropriate place. In this case, you can use the Edit mode to insert a PAUSE
command where you wish the procedure to stop. PAUSE causes the procedure to
halt execution and enter the Debug mode.

Once in Debug, you can use the PRINT command to examine the procedure
variables. You can use LET to manipulate the variable values to determine where
the error or errors occurred. Perhaps you forgot to initialize a variable or forgot to
increase a loop counter.

**Using the Trace Function**

Sometimes, errors are more difficult to discover. If so, the next step is to use the
trace function. To do this, type:

```
tron[ENTER]
```
Now press [ENTER]. Each time you press [ENTER], Debug executes one line of
the procedure. You can see the original source statement, and if an expression is
evaluated, Debug prints the result of the expression, preceded by an equal sign.

In this manner, you can step through the entire procedure, or any part of it,
examining variable values as you go.

**What About Loops?**

The STEP command is helpful if you find yourself tracing the operation of a loop.
Once you determine that the loop works correctly, you can avoid tedious, step-by-
step repetitions by turning trace off in using STEP to quickly run through the loop.
Then, turn trace back on and resume single-step debugging. For instance, type:

```
troff[ENTER]
```

**_Basic09 Reference_**

```
step 200[ENTER]
tron[ENTER]
```
**In Multiple Procedures**

Although the trace function is local to a procedure, you can pause and turn on the
trace function in as many procedures as you wish. Trace continues to operate in
each procedure until you turn it off using TROFF.

To cause a procedure to halt execution when it is called by another procedure, use
the BREAK command.


**Chapter 6**

**Data and Variables**

**Data Types**

_Data_ is information on which a computer performs its operations. Data is always
numeric but, depending on your computer application, it can represent values,
symbols, or alphabetic characters. This means that the same items of _physical_ data
can have very different _logical_ meanings, depending on how a program interprets
it.

For instance, 65 can represent:

```
 A numeric value to be used in a calculation.
 The location of a memory address.
 The offset of a memory location.
 The two character symbols 6 and 5.
 The character A in the ASCII table. ASCII is the abbreviation for the
American Standard Code for Information Interchange.
```
Because of the differences in how BASIC09 uses data, the system lets you define
five types of data. For instance, there are three ways to represent numbers. Each
has its own advantages and disadvantages. The decision to use one way or another
depends on the specific program you are developing. The five BASIC09 data types
are byte, integer, real, string, and boolean.

In addition to the preceding data types, there are _complex data types_ (also known
as _record_ types) that you can define. The manual discusses complex data structures
at the end of this chapter.

The _byte_ , _integer_ , and _real_ data types represent numbers.

The _string_ data type represents character data (alphabet, punctuation, numeric
characters, and other symbols). The default length of strings is 32 characters. Using
the DIM statement, you can specify strings varying in length from 0, a _null_ string,
to 32,767 characters (or until you reach the capacity of memory available to
BASIC09, whichever occurs first).

The _boolean_ data type represents the logical value, TRUE or FALSE.


**_Basic09 Reference_**

You can create arrays (lists) of these data types with one, two, or three dimensions.
The following table shows the data types and their characteristics:

```
Type Allowable Values Memory Requirements
BYTE Whole numbers
(0 to 255)
```
```
One byte
```
```
INTEGER Whole numbers
(-32768 to 32767)
```
```
Two bytes
```
```
REAL Floating point
(±1*10^ ±38)
```
```
Five bytes
```
```
STRING Letters, digits,
punctuation
```
```
One byte per character
```
```
BOOLEAN True or false One byte
```
Real numbers appear to be the most versatile. They have the greatest range and are
floating point. However, arithmetic operations involving real numbers execute
much more slowly than those involving integer or byte values. Real numbers also
take up considerably more memory storage space than the other two numeric data
types.

Arithmetic involving byte values is not appreciably faster than arithmetic involving
integers, but byte data conserves memory.

**If you do not specify the type of variable (a symbolic name for a value) in a
DIM statement, BASIC09 assumes the variable is real.**

**The Byte Data Type**

Byte variables hold unsigned eight-bit data (integers in the range of 0 through
255). Using byte values in computations, BASIC09 converts the byte values to 16-
bit integer values. If you store an integer value that is too large for the byte range,
BASIC09 stores only the least-significant eight bits (a value of 255 or less), and
does not return an error.

**The Integer Data Type**

Integer variables require two bytes (16 bits) of storage. They can fall in the range -
32768 to 32767. If a calculation involves both integer values and real values,
BASIC09 presents the result of the calculation as a real number.

You can use hexadecimal values in integer data. To do so, precede the value with
the dollar sign ($). For instance, to represent the decimal value 199 as
hexadecimal, type $C7. The hexadecimal value range is $0000 through $FFFF.


```
Data and Variables | 6
```
If you give an integer variable a value that is outside the integer range (greater than
32767 or less than -32768), BASIC09 does not produce an error. Instead, it _wraps
around_ the value range. For instance, the calculation 32767 +1 produces a result of
-32768.

This means that numeric comparisons made on values in the range 32768 through
65535 deal with negative numbers. You should limit such comparisons to tests for
equality or non-equality. Functions such as LAND, LNOT, LOR and LXOR use
integer values but produce results on a non-numeric, bit-by-bit, basis.

Division of an integer by another integer results in an integer. BASIC09 discards
any remainder.

**The Real Data Type**

If you do not assign a data type to a variable, BASIC09 assumes the variable is
real. However, programs are easier to understand if you define all variable types.

BASIC09 stores as real values any constants that have decimal points. If a constant
does not have a decimal point, BASIC09 stores it as an integer, except in the case
where the constant value exceeds the range of an integer. Then, it is converted to a
real value and is displayed with a decimal point.

BASIC09 requires five consecutive bytes to store real numbers. The first byte is
the exponent, in binary two’s complement. The next four bytes are the binary sign
and magnitude of the mantissa. The mantissa is in the first 31 bits; the sign of the
mantissa is in the last (least significant) bit of the last byte. The following
illustration shows the memory storage of a real number:

Internal Representation of Real Numbers

```
byte: 0 1 2 3 4
```
The exponent covers the range 2.938735877x10-39 (2-128) through
1.701411835x10^38 (2^127 ) as powers of 2. Operations that result in values out of the
representation range cause an overflow or underflow error. You can handle such
errors using the ON ERROR command.

The mantissa covers the range 0.5 through .9999999995 In steps of 2-31. This
means that real numbers can represent values .0000000005 apart. BASIC09 rounds
operation values that fall between these points to the nearest point.


**_Basic09 Reference_**

Because floating point arithmetic is inherently inexact, a sequence of operations
can produce a cumulative error. Proper rounding, as implemented in BASIC09,
reduces the effect of this problem, but cannot eliminate it. When using real
quantities in comparisons, be sure your computations can produce the exact value
you desire.

**The String Data Type**

A string is a variable-length sequence of ASCII values. The length can vary from
0, a _null_ string, to 32,767 characters (or until you reach the capacity of memory
available to BASIC09, whichever occurs first).

You can define a string variable either explicitly, using the DIM statement, or
implicitly by appending the dollar sign ($) to the variable identifier (variable
name). For example, title$ implicitly identifies a string variable.

Unless you specify otherwise, BASIC09 assigns a maximum string length of 32
characters. Using the DIM statement, you can specify a maximum length either
less than or greater than 32. To conserve memory, use DIM to assign only the
maximum length you need for any string variable.

The beginning of a string is always character 1. The BASE statement, which sets
numeric variable base numbers as either 0 or 1, does not affect string variables.

If an operation results in a string too long to fit in the assigned maximum storage
space, the system truncates the string on the right. It does not produce an error.

Storing storage is fixed at the dimensioned length. The sequence of actual string
byte values is terminated by the value of $FF ( 255 ), or by the maximum length
allotted to the string. Any unused storage after the termination byte allows the
stored string to expand and contract within its assigned length.

The following example shows the internal storage of a variable dimensioned as
string[6] and assigned the value "SAM". Note that byte 4 contains the string
terminator $FF. The string does not use bytes following $FF.

```
byte: 1 2 3 4 5 6
```
If you assign the value "ROBERT" to the variable, BASIC09 does not need to
terminate the string with $FF because the string is full:


```
Data and Variables | 6
```
```
byte: 1 2 3 4 5 6
```
The way BASIC09 handles string storage is important when you write programs. If
you do not specify a length for strings you define, the system uses the default
length 32. As you can see, this wastes computer memory if you store strings of
only four or five characters.

**The Boolean Data Type**

A boolean operation always returns the character string "TRUE" or "FALSE". You
cannot use the boolean data type for numeric computation—only for comparison
logic. NOTE: TRUE is stored internally as a byte value of 255 and FALSE as 0.
This can come in handy if you call a procedure where you receive data as
BOOLEAN (even if sent as BYTE or STRING), or if you use
PEEK(ADDR(boolean variable)). If BYTE values are received by a BASIC09
procedure as BOOLEAN, BASIC09 will consider a byte value of 0 as FALSE and
all others as TRUE.

Do not confuse the boolean operations AND, OR, XOR, and NOT (which operate
on the boolean values TRUE and FALSE) with the logical functions LAND, LOR,
LXOR and LNOT (which use integer values to produce numeric results on a bit-
by-bit basis). An attempt to store a non-boolean value In a boolean variable, causes
an error.

**Automatic Type Conversion**

When an operation mixes numeric data types (byte, integer, or real values),
BASIC09 automatically and temporarily converts the values to the type necessary
to retain accuracy. This conversion lets you use numeric quantities of mixed types
in most calculations.

The system returns a type-mismatch error when an expression includes types that
cannot legally mix. These errors are reported by the second compiler pass, which
occurs automatically when you exit the edit mode.

Because type conversion takes additional execution time, you can speed
calculations by using values of a single type.


**_Basic09 Reference_**

**Constants**

_Constants_ are values in a program that do not change. They can use any of the five
data types. The following are examples of constants in a procedure:

```
HOME$="Fort Worth"
VALUE$="25,000"
VALUE=25
PAYMENT=99.99
ANSWER="TRUE"
MEMORY=$0CFF
PRINT "The End"
```
Numeric constants are either integers or real numbers. If a numeric constant
includes a decimal point or uses the "E format" exponential form, it causes
BASIC09 to store the number in the real format, even if it could store the number
in integer or byte format.

You can use this feature to _force_ a real format. For instance, to make the number
12 a real number, type it as 12.0. You might want to force real values in this way
when all other values in an expression are real so that BASIC09 does not have to
do a time-consuming type conversion at run time.

BASIC09 also stores as real numbers any numbers that do not have decimal points
but that are too large to store as integers. Here are some examples of legal real
constants:

```
1.0 9.8433218 -.01
-999.000099 100000000 5644.34532
1.95E+12 -99999.9E-33
```
BASIC09 treats numbers that do not have a decimal point and are in the range -
32768 through +32767 as integers. You must always precede hexadecimal
numbers with a dollar sign.

Following are examples of legal integer constants:

```
12 -3000 55
$20 $FF $09
0 -12 -32768
```
**String Constants**

A string constant consists of a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotation
marks, such as:


```
Data and Variables | 6
"The End"
```
To place a string constant into a string type variable, use the = symbol in this
manner:

```
TITLE$ = "Masters Of Magic"
```
To include double quotation marks within a string, use two sets of double
quotation marks, like this:

```
"An ""older man"" is wiser."
```
A string can contain characters that have ASCII values in the range 0 through 255.

**Variables**

In BASIC09, a variable is _local_ to the procedure in which it is defined. A variable
defined in one procedure has no meaning in another procedure unless you use the
RUN and PARAM statements to pass the variable when you call the other
procedure.

The local nature of variables lets you use the same variable name in more than one
procedure and, unless you specify otherwise, have the variables operate
independently of each other.

You can assign variables using either the LET statement with the assignment
operator (=), or by using the assignment operator alone. Alternately, you can also
use the := assignment operator. For instance, both of the following command lines
are legal:

```
LET PAYMENT=44.50
PAYMENT:=44.50
```
When you call a procedure, BASIC09 allocates storage for the procedure's
variables. It is not possible to force a variable to occupy an absolute address in
memory. When you exit a procedure, the system returns the storage allocated for
the variables, and you lose the stored values.

If you write a procedure to call itself (a _recursive_ procedure), the call creates
separate storage space for variables.

```
Note: Unlike other BASICs, BASIC09 does not automatically
initialized variables by setting them to zero. When you execute a
procedure, all variables, arrays, and structures have random values.
Your procedure must initialize the variables you specify to the
values you require.
```

**_Basic09 Reference_**

**Passing Variables**

When one procedure passes variable values to another procedure, BASIC09 refers
to the passed variables as _parameters_. You can pass variables either by _reference_
or by _value_.

**Passing By Reference**

BASIC09 **does not** protect variables passed by reference. Therefore, the called
procedure can change the values and return the new values.

To pass parameters by reference:

```
RUN ADDCOLUMN(x) pass by reference
```
The system evaluates the storage address of each passed variable, and sends the
variable to the called procedure. The called procedure associates the storage
addresses with the names in its local PARAM statement. It then uses the storage
area as though it had created it locally. This means that it can change the value of
the parameter before returning it to the calling procedure.

**Passing By Value**
BASIC09 **does** protect variables passed by value, so, the called procedure cannot
change them.

To pass parameters by value, write the value to be passed as an expression.
BASIC09 evaluates the expression at the time of the call. To use a variable in an
expression without changing its value, use null constants, such as 0 for a number or
"" for a string, in this manner:

```
RUN ADDCOLUMN(x+0) passes the value of x by value
RUN TRANSLATE(w$+"") passes the contents of w$ by value
```
To pass parameters by value, BASIC09 creates a temporary variable. It places the
result of the expression in the temporary variable and sends the address to the
called procedure. This means that the value given to the called procedure is a _copy_
of the result of the expression, and the called procedure cannot change the original
value.

The results of expressions containing numeric constants are either integer or real
values; there are no byte constants. To send byte-type variables to a procedure,
pass the values by reference. Therefore, if a RUN statement evaluates an integer as
a perimeter and sends it to a byte-type variable, the byte Variable uses only the
high-order byte of the two-byte integer.


```
Data and Variables | 6
```
**Arrays**

An _array_ is a group of related data values stored consecutively in memory. The
system knows the entire group by a variable name. Each data value is an _element_.
You use a _subscript_ to refer to any element of the array. For example, an array
named Graf might contain five elements referred to as:

```
Graf(1) Graf(2) Graf(3) Graf(4) Graf(5)
```
You can use each of these elements to store a different value, such as:

```
Graf(1) = 25
Graf(2) = 47
Graf(3) = 39
Graf(4) = 18
Graf(5) = 50
Note: Normally, array elements start with 1 in BASIC09. However,
you can use the BASE statement to cause array elements to begin at
0.
```
The previous example illustrates a single-dimensioned array. The elements are
arranged in one row and only one subscript is used for each element.

The following procedure lets you type values for a GRAF array and displays the
results in a simple graph.

```
PROCEDURE GRAF
cDIM GRAF(5):REAL
cPRINT CHR$(12)
cFOR T=1 TO 5
cPRINT "Value for Item #"; T; "c";
cINPUT GRAF(T)
cNEXT T
cPRINT
cPRINT
cPRINT "This is how your graph stacks up..."
cPRINT
cFOR T=1 TO 5
cPRINT "Item #"; T; "c";
cFOR U=1 TO GRAF(T)
cPRINT CHR$(79);
cNEXT U

This procedure uses a single dimension array—in effect, a list.

You can also create arrays with more than one dimension — more than one
element for each row. You might use a two-dimensioned array in a procedure to
store names and addresses. Instead of creating separate arrays for the name,
address, and zip code, you could set up one array with two dimensions.

The following procedure, used to enter the names of a company's employees,
shows how this might be done. See the second line for the DIM syntax. When you
run the procedure, it asks you for a name, address, and zip code for each of 10
employees. After you type the information for all the entries, the procedure
displays the information on the screen.

```
PROCEDURE Names
cDIM NAME(10,3):STRING
cPRINT CHR$(12)
cBASE 0
cFOR T=0 TO 9
cPRINT "Type Employee Name No."; T; ": ";
cINPUT NAME(T,0)
cPRINT "Type Employee Address No."; T; ": ";
cINPUT NAME(T,1)
cPRINT "Type Employee Zip Code No."; T; ": ";
cINPUT NAME(T,2)
cNEXT T
cPRINT CHR$(12)
cPRINT "And the names are..."
cPRINT
cFOR T=0 TO 9
cPRINT NAME(T,0); "c"; NAME(T,1); "c"; NAME(T,2)
cNEXT T
cEND
```
The DIM statement reserves space in memory for a string array named NAME
with two dimensions. As you enter data, the Name field is stored in NAME(0,0),
NAME(1,0), NAME(2,0), and so on. The Address field is stored in NAME(0,1),
NAME(1,1), NAME(2,1), and so on. The Zip Code field is stored in NAME(0,2),


```
Data and Variables | 6
```
NAME(1,2), NAME(2,2), and so on. This continues until you fill the _grid_ , 10
entries with three items each.

You can also create the arrays with three dimensions. The following procedure
adds one more dimension that keeps track of each employee's company. It
dimensions Name$ as Name$(2,10,3). The first dimension contains either 0 or 1 to
indicate which company the employee works for.

```
PROCEDURE Names2
cDIM NAME$(2,10,3):STRING
cPRINT CHR$(12)
cBASE 0
cFOR X=0 TO 1
cPRINT
cPRINT
cFOR T=0 TO 9
cPRINT
cIF X=0 THEN
cPRINT "Type a Wiggleworth Company Employee Name"
cELSE
cPRINT "Type a Putforth Company Employee Name"
cENDIF
cPRINT "Type Name No."; T; ": ";
cINPUT NAME$(X,T,0)
cPRINT "Type Address No."; T; ": ";
cINPUT NAME$(X,T,1)
cPRINT "Type Zip Code No."; T; ": ";
cINPUT NAME$(X,T,2)
cNEXT T
cNEXT X
cPRINT CHR$(12)
cPRINT "The Wiggleworth employees are..."
cPRINT
cX=0
cFOR T=0 TO 9
cPRINT NAME$(X,T,0); "c"; NAME$(X,T,1); "c";
NAME$(X,T,2)
cNEXT T
cPRINT
cPRINT "The Putforth employees are..."
```

**_Basic09 Reference_**

```
cPRINT
cX=1
cFOR T=0 TO 9
cPRINT NAME$(X,T,0); "c"; NAME$(X,T,1); "c";
NAME$(X,T,2)
cNEXT T
cEND
```
The easiest way to understand three dimensional arrays is to consider the first
dimension as a _page_. In other words if the first dimension in the string is 0, the
employee is on the Wiggleworth Company's page. If the first dimension in the
string is 1, the employee is on the Putforth Company's page.

**Complex Data Types**

In addition to the five standard data types, you can create your own data types.
Using the TYPE statement, you can define a new data type as a _vector_ (a single-
dimensioned array) of any previously defined type.

For example, in the previous procedure, the NAME variable can only contain one
data type, the string type. However, using the TYPE statement you can create a
variable that accepts several data types. Suppose you create an employee list
procedure that uses the following variables, of the following size and types:

```
Name Length Contents Type
Name 25 employee name string
Street 20 street address string
City 10 city of address string
Zip Code — address zip code integer
Sex — false = male, true = female boolean
Age — employee age byte
```
You can combine all these variables into one complex data type. To do so,
dimension the variables within a TYPE statement like this:

```
TYPE EMPLOYEE=NAME:STRING[25]; STREET:STRING[20];
CITY:STRING[10]; ZIP:REAL; SEX:BOOLEAN; AGE:BYTE
```
This creates a new BASIC09 type, called EMPLOYEE. EMPLOYEE requires its
variables to have six fields of the name, size, and type shown in the previous chart.

Once you create the new data type, you can define variables to use it. For instance,
the following source instruction defines WORKER as type EMPLOYEE with 10
elements in the array:


```
Data and Variables | 6
DIM WORKER(10):EMPLOYEE
```
To put the EMPLOYEE data type to work, collect your data with INPUT
commands. Then, store the data into the new WORKER array. The following
procedure demonstrates how you might do this:

```
PROCEDURE worker
cREM cccccccccDimension variables for input
cDIM NM:STRING[25]
cDIM ST:STRING[20]
cDIM CTY:STRING[10]
cDIM ZP:REAL
cDIM SX:BOOLEAN
cDIM AG:BYTE
cREM Create new type and array using new type
cTYPE EMPLOYEE=NAME:STRING[25]; STREET:STRING[20];
CITY:STRING[10]; ZIP:REAL; SEX:BOOLEAN; AGE:BYTE
cDIM WORKER(10):EMPLOYEE
cREM
cFOR T=1 TO 10
cINPUT "Name:c",NM
cINPUT "Street:c",ST
cINPUT "City:c",CTY
cINPUT "Zip:c",ZP
cINPUT "Sex:c",SX
cINPUT "Age:c",AG
cREM cccccccStore input ln the Worker array
using field names
cWORKER(T).NAME=NM
cWORKER(T).STREET=ST
cWORKER(T).CITY=CTY
cWORKER(T).ZIP=ZP
cWORKER(T).SEX=SX
cWORKER(T).AGE=AG
cPRINT
cPRINT "* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *"
cPRINT
cNEXT T
cPRINT CHR$(12);
cPRINT "The names in your files now are..."
```

**_Basic09 Reference_**

```
cPRINT
cFOR T=1 TO 10
cPRINT WORKER(T).NAME
cPRINT WORKER(T).STREET
cPRINT WORKER(T).CITY
cPRINT WORKER(T).ZIP
cIF WORKER(T).SEX=TRUE THEN
cPRINT "Female"
cELSE
cPRINT "Male"
cENDIF
cPRINT WORKER(T).AGE
cPRINT
cPRINT "* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *"
cPRINT
cNEXT T
```
Note that the SEX field is defined as BOOLEAN. This means that you can respond
only in two ways, TRUE or FALSE. The method of input requires only one byte of
storage. To use this data you need to handle it So TRUE and FALSE indicate male
and female.

Complex data types can contain more than one field. Each field can be of any data
type. You referenced the fields of a complex data type by typing the variable name,
its array index, a period (.), and the field name. The following lines, from the
worker procedure, shows how BASIC09 stores the data from the input lines into
the WORKER variable:

WORKER(T).HAME=NM
WORKER(T).STREET=ST
WORKER(T).CITY=CTY
WORKER(T).ZIP=ZP
WORKER(T).SEX=SX
WORKER(T).AGE=AG
These lines store the values in the variables NM, ST, , CTY, ZP, SX and AG into
the NAME, STREET, , CITY, ZIP, SEX and AGE Fields of the WORKER
variable. This operation is within a FOR/NEXT loop that uses T as a counter. In
the procedure T can refer to a value in the range 1 to 10.


```
Data and Variables | 6
```
The procedure uses the same type of operation to extract the data from the complex
data type variable:

PRINT WORKER(T).NAME
PRINT WORKER(T).STREET
PRINT WORKER(T).CITY
PRINT WORKER(T).ZIP
IF WORKER(T).SEX=TRUE THEN
PRINT "Female"
ELSE
PRINT "Male"
ENDIF
PRINT WORKER(T).AGE
Using the same methods, you can create complex data types that combine other
complex data types and standard data types.

The elements of a complex structure can be copied to another similar structure.
Using a single assignment operator, you can write an entire structure to, or read an
entire structure from, mass storage as a single entity. For example:

```
PUT #2, WORKER(T)
```
Because the system defines the elements of complex-type storage during
compilation, it need not do so during _runtime_. This means that BASIC09 can
reference complex structures faster than it can reference arrays.


**Chapter 7**

**Expressions, Operators, and Functions**

**Manipulating Data**

BASIC09 uses _expressions_ to manipulate data. (Expressions are pieces of data
connected by operators.)

An _operator_ is a symbol or a word that signifies some action to be performed on
the specified data. Each data item is a value.

**Expressions**

When an expression is evaluated, the result is a value of some data type (real,
integer, string, byte, or boolean).

An expression might look like this:

```
First
Value
```
```
First
Operator
```
```
Second
Value
```
```
Second
Operato
r Result
```
```
6 + 5 = 11
```
```
or like this:
```
```
First
Value
```
```
First
Operator
```
```
Second
Value
```
```
Second
Operato
r Result
```
```
“Seaside” + “Villa” =
```
```
Seaside
Villa
```
When BASIC09 evaluates an expression, it copies each value onto an expression
stack. Functions and operators take their input values from this stack and return
their results to it. Many expressions result in assignments, as do the examples
shown. Then BASIC09 makes the resulting assignment only after it computes the
entire expression. This lets you use the variable that is being modified as one of the
values in the expression, such as in this example:


**_Expressions, Operators, and Func,ons_** **|** **_7_**
X=X+1
The result of an expression is always one of the five BASIC09 data types.
However, you can often mix data types within an expression and, in some cases,
the result of an expression is of a different data type than any of the values in the
expression. Such is the case if you use the less-than symbol (<), in this manner:

24 < 188
The less-than operator compares two integer values. The result of the comparison
is boolean; in this case, the value is TRUE.

**Type Conversion**

Because BASIC09 performs automatic type conversion of values, you can mix any
of the three numeric data types in an expression. When you mix numeric data
types, the result is always of the same type as the value having the largest
representation, in this order: real < integer < byte.

You can use any numeric type in an expression that produces a real number. If you
want an expression to produce a byte or integer type value, the result must be small
enough to fit the desired type.

**Operators**

BASIC09 has operators to deal with all types of data. Each operator, except NOT
and negation (unary -), takes two values or operands, and performs an operation to
produce a result. NOT can accept only one value. The following table lists the
operators available and the types of data they accept and produce.

Because the same operators function on the three types of numeric data (byte,
integer, and real), these types are referred to by the operand type "numeric."

**BASIC09 Expression Operators**

```
Operator Function
```
```
Operand
Type
```
```
Result
Type
```
- Negation numeric numeric
~or ** Exponentiation numeric numeric
* Multiplication numeric numeric
/ Division numeric numeric
+ Addition numeric numeric
- Subtraction numeric numeric


**_Basic09 Reference_**

```
NOT Logical Negation boolean boolean
AND Logical AND boolean boolean
OR Logical OR boolean boolean
XOR Logical Exclusive OR boolean boolean
+ Concatenation string string
= Equal to all types boolean
<> or >< Not equal to all types boolean
< Less than numeric, string† boolean
<= or =< Less than or equal numeric, string† boolean
> Greater than numeric, string† boolean
>= or => Greater than or equal numeric, string† boolean
```
```
† When comparing strings, BASIC09 uses the ASCII values of characters as the
basis for comparison. Therefore, 0 < 1, 9 < A, A < B, A < b, b < z and so on.
```
**Arithmetic Operators**

_Arithmetic operators_ perform operations on numeric data. Therefore, both
operands in the expression must be numeric. The following table lists the
arithmetic operators.

```
Negation The single dash negates a number’s sign:
-10 is negative 10.
```
```
Exponentiation Use a caret (^) or two asterisks (**) to raise a number to a power:
2^3 is 8 (2x 2 x 2).
Similarly, 2**3 is 8.
```
```
Multiplication A single asterisk causes multiplication:
2*3 is 6.
```
```
Division A slash causes division: 6 / 2 is 3.
```
```
Addition The plus sign causes addition:
3 + 3 is 6.
```
```
Subtraction A dash causes subtraction: 6 - 3 is 2.
```

```
Expressions, Operators, and Func,ons | 7
```
**Hierarchy of Operators**

BASIC09 uses the standard hierarchy of operations when calculating expressions
with multiple operators. This means that BASIC09 has an order in which it
performs calculations involving more than one operator.

The following BASIC09 operators are listed in order of precedence:

NOT - (negate}
^ **
* /
+ -
> < <> = >= <=
AND
OR XOR
Also, BASIC09:

```
 Performs operations enclosed in parentheses before operations not in
parentheses.
 Performs the leftmost operations first when two or more operations are of
equal precedence.
```
You can use parentheses to override this standard precedence.

For example:

2 + 1 * 3 = 5
but

(2 + 1) * 3 = 9
The following examples show BASIC09 expressions on the left, and the way
BASIC09 evaluates them on the right. You can enter the expressions in either
form, but the decompiler generates the simpler form, shown on the left.

```
BASIC09 Representation Equivalent Form
a=b+c**2/d a=b+((c**2)/d)
a=b>c AND d>e OR c=e a=((b>c) AND (d>e)) OR (e=e)
a=(b+c+d)/e a=((b+c)+d)/e
a=b**c**d/e a=(b**(c**d))/e
a=-(b)**2 a=(-b)**2
```

**_Basic09 Reference_**

**Relational Operators**

_Relational operators_ make logical comparisons of any type of data and return a
result of either TRUE or FALSE. An explanation of the relational operators
follows. All relational operators have equal precedence.

```
= Equal. Returns TRUE if both operands are equal, or FALSE if they are
not equal.
```
```
< Less than: Returns TRUE if the first operand is less than the second, or
FALSE if is not.
```
```
> Greater than: Returns TRUE if the first operand is greater than the
second, or FALSE if it is not.
```
```
<> or
><
```
```
Unequal: Returns TRUE if the operands are not equal or FALSE if they
are.
```
```
<= or
=<
```
```
Less than or equal to: Returns TRUE if the first operand is less than or
equal to the second operand. Otherwise, the operation returns FALSE.
```
```
>= or
=>
```
```
Greater than or equal to: Returns TRUE if the first operand is greater than
or equal to the second. Otherwise, the operation returns FALSE.
```
You normally use relational operators in IF/THEN statements. For example, if
your procedure has two numeric variables, Payments and Income, you might
include command lines like this:

IF PAYMENTS > INCOME THEN
PRINT "You’re Broke!"
ENDIF
When you combine arithmetic and relational operators in the same expression,
BASIC09 evaluates the arithmetic operations first. For example:

IF X*Y/2 <= 14 THEN
PRINT "Average Score is "; X*Y/2
ENDIF
BASIC09 performs the arithmetic operation x+y/2, then compares the result with
the value 14.

When you use relational operators with strings, BASIC09 compares the strings
character by character. When it finds two characters that do not match, it checks to
see which character has the lower ASCII code value. The string containing the
character with the lower value comes first.


```
Expressions, Operators, and Func,ons | 7
```
Consider this example:

PRINT "hunt" > "hung"
BASIC09 compares each character in each string. Because the first three characters
are the same, the result of the operation is based on the comparison of t and g.
Because t (ASCII value = 116) is "greater than" g (ASCII value = 103), the
command prints TRUE.

**String Operators**

The string operator is the plus sign (+). This symbol appends one string to another.
All operands must be strings, and the resulting value is one string. Examine, for
example, the following line, which appends three strings:

PRINT "My friends are " + "Jack and " + "Jill."
It prints: My friends are Jack and Jill.

**Logical Operators**

The logical, or boolean, operators make logical comparisons of boolean values.
The following table describes the results yielded by each logical operator given the
specified TRUE/FALSE values:

```
Operator
```
```
Meaning of
Operation
```
```
First
Operand
```
```
Second
Operand Result
```
```
NOT The result is the opposite of the operand. TRUE
FALSE
```
##### FALSE

##### TRUE

```
AND When both values are TRUE, the result is
TRUE. Otherwise, the result is FALSE.
```
##### TRUE

##### TRUE

##### FALSE

##### FALSE

##### TRUE

##### FALSE

##### TRUE

##### FALSE

##### TRUE

##### FALSE

##### FALSE

##### FALSE

```
OR When both values are FALSE, the result is
FALSE. Otherwise, the result is TRUE.
```
##### FALSE

##### TRUE

##### TRUE

##### FALSE

##### FALSE

##### TRUE

##### FALSE

##### TRUE

##### FALSE

##### TRUE

##### TRUE

##### TRUE

```
XOR When only one of the values is TRUE, the
result is TRUE. Otherwise the result is
FALSE.
```
##### TRUE

##### FALSE

##### TRUE

##### FALSE

##### FALSE

##### TRUE

##### TRUE

##### FALSE

##### TRUE

##### TRUE

##### FALSE

##### FALSE

Use logical operators in IF/THEN statements such as:

```
IF PAYMENTS < INCOME AND INCOME+SAVINGS >
PAYMENTS THEN
```

**_Basic09 Reference_**

```
PRINT "You‘ll have to use your savings to get
out of this mess."
ENDIF
```
**Functions**

_Functions_ are operation sequences the system performs on data. In a statement,
BASIC09 performs functions first. Chapter 11, “Command Reference,” describes
the following functions.

**Functions returning results of type real:
SIN** Calculates the trigonometric sine of a number.

file occurs.


**Chapter 8**

**Disk Files**

When you tell NitrOS-9 or BASIC09 to store (save) data on a disk, it stores the
data in a _logical_ block called a _file_. The term logical means that, although the
system might store portions of a file's data in several different disk locations, it
keeps track of every location and treats the scattered data as though it occupied a
single block. It does this automatically and you never need to worry about how the
data is stored. File data can be binary data, textual data (ASCII characters), or any
other useful information.

Because NitrOS-9 handles all hardware input/output devices (disk drives, printers,
terminals, and so on) in the same manner, you can send data to any of these
devices in the same way. This means you can send the same information to several
devices by changing the path the data follows. For example, you can test a
procedure that communicates with a terminal by transferring data to and from a
disk drive.

BASIC09 normally works with two types of files—sequential files and random
access files. The following chart shows file-access options, their purposes, and the
keywords with which to use them:

**Types of Access for Files**

```
Access
Type Function Use with
```
```
DIR Opens a directory file for reading. Use only with READ. OPEN
```
```
EXEC Specifies that the file to open or create is in the execution
directory, rather than the data directory.
```
##### OPEN

##### CREATE

##### READ

```
Lets you read data from the specified file or device.
```
##### OPEN

##### CREATE

##### WRITE

```
Lets you write data to the specified file or device.
```
##### OPEN

##### CREATE


```
Disk Files | 8
```
```
UPDATE Lets you read data from and write data to the specified file
or device.
```
##### OPEN

##### CREATE

**Sequential Files**

Sequential files send or receive (WRITE or READ) textual data in order, the
second item following the first, and so on. You can access sequential data only in
the same order as you originally stored it. To read from or write to a particular
section of a file, you must first read through all the preceding data in the file,
starting from the beginning.

BASIC09 stores sequential file data as ASCII characters. Each block of data is
separated by a _delimiter_ consisting of a carriage-return character (ASCII character
13). Because BASIC09 uses this delimiter to determine the end of a _record_ ,
sequential files can contain records of varying length.

Use the WRITE and READ commands to store and retrieve data in sequential files.
A WRITE command causes BASIC09 to transfer specified data to a specified file,
ending the data with a carriage return. A READ command causes BASIC09 to load
from the specified file the next block of data, stopping when it reaches a carriage
return.

**Sequential File Creation, Storage, and Retrieval**

BASIC09 uses the CREATE command to establish both sequential and random
access files. A CREATE statement contains:

```
 The keyword CREATE.
```
```
 A path number variable in which BASIC09 stores the number of the path it
opens to the new file.
```
```
 A comma, followed by the name of the file to create.
 An optional colon, followed by the access mode. If you do not specify an
access mode, BASIC09 automatically opens the created file in the UPDATE
mode.
```
The following procedure shows how to create a file and write data into it:


**_Basic09 Reference_**

```
PROCEDURE makefile
DIM PATH:BYTE \ (* establishes a variable
REM for the path number to the file
CREATE #PATH,"TEST":WRITE \ (* creates the file TEST
WRITE #PATH,"This is a test" \ (* writes data to the file
WRITE #PATH,"of sequential files." \(* writes another line of data
CLOSE #PATH \ (* closes the path to the file
SHELL "LIST TEST" \ (* displays the file contents
END
```
The first line of the procedure dimensions a variable (Path) to hold the number of
the path that CREATE opens. This variable should be of byte or integer type.

When you establish a new file with CREATE, you automatically open a path to the
file. You do not need to use the OPEN command.

The preceding procedure writes two lines into a file named Test. It then closes the
path and uses the NitrOS-9 LIST command to display the contents of the newly
created file. You see that the data is successfully stored on disk.

The next procedure shows how to reopen an existing file for sequential access,
read the contents of the file, and append data to the end of the file.

The only way to move the file pointer to the end of a sequential file is to read all
the data already in the file. Once the pointer is at the end of the file, you can add
data.

```
PROCEDURE append
DIM PATH:BYTE \ (* dimension variable to hold the
REM number of the path to the opened file.
OPEN #PATH, "TEST":UPDATE \(* open file for reading and writing.
READ #PATH, line$ \ (* read the first element of the file.
READ #PATH, 1ine$ \ (* read the next (the last) element.
WRITE #PATH,"This is a test" \(* write one new line to the file.
WRITE #PATH,"of appending to a sequential file." \(* write
another.
CLOSE #PATH \ (* close the path.
SHELL "LIST TEST" \ (* display the file with the new lines.
END
```
Because the Test file already exists, this procedure uses OPEN to establish a path
to the file. It uses the UPDATE mode of file access because it needs to both read
from and write to the file.

The two READ statements read the file’s contents and, as a result, move the file
pointer to the end of the file. The WRITE statements then append two new lines.
After closing the path, the procedure calls on the NitrOS-9 LIST command to
display the contents of the file, with its appended lines.


```
Disk Files | 8
```
**Changing Data in a Sequential File**

You can also change data anywhere in a sequential file. However, if your changes
are longer than the original data, the operation destroys part of the file. To change
data in a sequential file, read the data preceding what you want to change, and
write the new data to the file in this manner:

```
PROCEDURE replace
DIM PATH:BYTE
OPEN #PATH, "TEST":UPDATE
READ #PATH, Line$
READ #PATH, Line$
WRITE #PATH,“Let‘s put new" \ (* write over existing 3rd and
WRITE #PATH,"words into the old sequential file." \(* 4th lines.
CLOSE #PATH
SHELL "LIST TEST"
END
```
Notice that the total amount of data in the two new lines is exactly the same as in
the two old lines. You can replace an existing line with fewer characters by
padding the new data with spaces. However, if you try to replace existing lines
with longer lines, the new lines write over and destroy other data in the file.

The above example procedures use the SHELL statement to execute a NitrOS-9
command (LIST). Using the SHELL statement is not the best way to perform tasks
within a BASIC09 procedure. Below is a better alternative for use with the above
examples.

Replace the SHELL "LIST TEST" statements in the above procedures with:

```
RUN ListFile("TEST")
```
Then add a new procedure to the workspace:

```
PROCEDURE ListFile
DIM PATH:BYTE

**_Basic09 Reference_**

**INPUT and Sequential Files**

Although you can also use the INPUT command with sequential files, doing so
might put unwanted data into them. When a procedure encounters INPUT, it
suspends execution and sends a question mark (?) to the screen. This feature makes
INPUT both an input and output statement. Therefore, if you open a file using the
UPDATE mode, INPUT writes its prompts to the file, destroying data. If you
specify text to be displayed with the INPUT command, INPUT writes this text to
the file also.

**Random Access Files**

Random access files store data in fixed- or equal-length blocks. Because each
record in a specific file is the same size, you can easily calculate the position of a
record.

For instance, suppose you have a file with a record length of 50-bytes (or
characters). To access Record 10, multiply the record number (10) by the record
length (50} and move the file pointer to the calculated position (500).

A random access file sends and receives data (using PUT and GET) in a binary
form, exactly as BASICO9 stores it internally. This feature minimizes the time
involved in converting the data to and from ASCII representation, as well as
reducing the file space required to store numeric data. You position the random
access file pointer using SEEK. Compared to sequential file access, random file
access using GET and PUT is very fast.

Using random access commands, you can store and retrieve individual bytes,
strings of bytes, individual elements of arrays or total arrays with one PUT or GET
command. When you GET a structure, you recover the number of bytes associated
with that type of structure.

This means when you GET one element of byte type data, you read one byte.
When you GET one element of real type data, you read five bytes. If you GET an
array, you read all the elements of the array. This potential for reading entire arrays
at once can greatly speed disk access.

As well as moving the file pointer to the beginning of individual records, you can
also move it to any position within a record and begin reading or writing one or
more bytes from that point.

**Creating Random Access Files**

You create and open random access files in the same way you create and open
sequential files. The only differences are in the commands you use to store and
retrieve the data and in the manner you keep track of where elements, or records,
of a file begin and end.

Before you can write data to a random access file, you must either CREATE it or
open it in the WRITE or UPDATE mode. Once you have a path open to an existing
file, use PUT to write data into the file. If you open the file in the READ or
UPDATE mode, you can then use the GET command to retrieve data from the file.

The PUT command can use only one parameter, the name of the data element to
store. The parameter can be a string, a variable, an array, or a complex data
structure,

Before storing data, you must devise a method to store it in blocks of equal size.
Knowing the unit size lets you later retrieve the data in its original form. The
following procedure shows one way to do this:

```
PROCEDURE putget
cREM This procedure creates a file named TEST1,
cREM reads 10 data lines, PUTs them into the file,
cREM then closes the file. Next it opens the file
cREM in READ mode, GETs the stored lines and lists
cREM them on the display screen.
```
```
cDIM LENGTH:BYTE
cDIM NULL:STRING[25]
cDIM LINE: STRING[25]
cDIM PATH:BYTE
cLENGTH=25
cNULL="ccccccccccccccccccccccccc"
cBASE 0
cON ERROR GOTO 10
cDELETE "TEST1" \ (* if the file exists, delete it.
c10 ON ERROR
```
```
cCREATE #PATH,"TEST1":WRITE \ (* create a file named TEST1.
cFOR T=0 TO 9
cSEEK #PATH,LENGTH*T \ (* find beginning of each line.
cREAD LINE \ (* read a line of data.
cPUT #PATH,LINE \ (* store the line in the file.
cNEXT T
cCLOSE #PATH \ (* close the file.
```

**_Basic09 Reference_**

```
cOPEN #PATH,"TEST1":READ \ (* open the file for reading.
cFOR T=0 TO 9
cSEEK #PATH,LENGTH*T \ (* find the beginning of each line.
cGET #PATH,LINE \ (* get a line from the file.
cPRINT LINE \ (* display the line.
cNEXT T
```
```
cCLOSE #PATH \ (* close the file.
cEND
```
```
cDATA "This is test line #1."
cDATA "This is test line #2."
cDATA "This is test line #3."
cDATA "This is fest line #4."
cDATA "This is test line #5."
cDATA "This is test line #6."
cDATA "This is test line #7."
cDATA "This is test line #8."
cDATA "This is test line #9."
cDATA "This is test line #10."
```
This procedure creates a file named TESTl. The variable named LENGTH stores
the length of each line in the file (25 characters). The string variable NULL, is a
string of 25 space characters. The variable LINE contains the data to store in each
element (record) in the file. The variable PATH stores the path number of the file.

Next, the procedure contains an ON ERROR routine that deletes the file TESTl, if
it already exists. Without this routine, the procedure produces an error if you
execute it more than once.

Next, the routine uses CREATE to open the file TESTl. The line SEEK #PATH,
LENGTH*T sets the file pointer to the proper location to store the next line.
Because LENGTH is established as 25, the file lines are stored at 0, 25, 50, 75, and
so on.

After the routine initializes storage space, it begins to store data by reading the
procedure data lines one at a time, seeking the proper file location, and putting the
data into the file. After storing all 10 lines, it closes the file.

The last part of the routine opens the new file, uses the same SEEK routine to
position the file pointer, and reads the lines back, one at a time, to confirm that the
store routine is successful.

The next short routine shows how you can use a procedure to read any line you
select in the file, without reading any preceding lines:


```
Disk Files | 8
```
```
PROCEDURE randomread
cDIM LENGTH:BYTE
cDIM LINE:STRING[25]
cDIM SEEKLINE:BYTE
cDIM PATH:BYTE
cLENGTH=25
cOPEN #PATH,"TEST1":READ \ (* open the file for reading.
cLOOP
cINPUT "Line number to display...",SEEKLINE \(* type a line to get.
cEXITIF SEEKLINE>10 OR SEEKLINE<1 THEN \(* test if record is valid.
cENDEXIT \ (* exit loop if not.
cSEEK #PATH, (SEEKLINE-1)*LENGTH \(* find the requested record.
cGET #PATH,LINE \ (* read the record.
cPRINT LINE \ (* display the record.
cPRINT
cENDLOOP
cPRINT "That's all ....... " \ (* end session.
cCLOSE #PATH \ (* close path.
cEND
```
The procedure asks for the record number of the line to display. When you type the
number (1-10) and press [ENTER], SEEK moves the file pointer to the beginning
of the record you want, GET reads it into the variable LINE, and PRINT displays
it. The calculation (SEEKLINE-1)*LENGTH determines the beginning of the
line you want. If you type a number outside the range of lines contained in the file
(1-10), the procedure drops down to line 100 and ends.

By changing this procedure slightly, you can replace any line in the procedure with
another line. The altered procedure below demonstrates this:

```
PROCEDURE random_replace
cDIM LENGTH:BYTE
cDIM LINE:STRING[25]
cDIM SEEKLINE:BYTE
cDIM PATH:BYTE
cLENGTH=25
cOPEN #PATH,"TEST1":UPDATE \ (* open the file.
cLOOP
cINPUT "Line number to display...",SEEKLINE \(* type record to
find.
cEXITIF SEEKLINE>10 OR SEEKLINE<1 THEN \(* test if valid number.
cENDEXIT \ (* exit loop if not.
cSEEK #PATH,(SEEKLINE-1)*LENGTH \(* find the requested record.
cGET #PATH,LINE \ (* get the data.
cPRINT LINE \ (* print the record.
cPRINT
```

**_Basic09 Reference_**

```
cINPUT "Type new Line... ",LINE \(* type a new line.
cSEEK #PATH, (SEEKLINE-1)*LENGTH \(* find beginning of the record.
cPUT #PATH,LINE \ (* store the new line.
cENDLOOP \ (* do it all again.
cPRINT "That’s all ....... " \ (* terminate procedure.
cCLOSE #PATH \ (* close path.
cEND
```
This time, the file is opened in the UPDATE mode to allow both reading and
writing. You type the line you want to display. A prompt then asks you to type a
new line. The procedure exchanges the new line for the original line, and stores it
back in the file.

**Using Arrays With Random Access Files**

BASIC09’s random access filing system is even more impressive when used with
data structures, such as arrays. Instead of using a loop to store the 10 lines of the
random_replace procedure, you could store them all at once, into one record, using
an array. The following procedure illustrates this:

```
PROCEDURE arraywrite
cDIM LENGTH:BYTE
cDIM LINE:STRING[25]
cDIM RECORD(10):STRING[25]
cDIM PATH:BYTE
cLENGTH=25
```
```
cON ERROR GOTO 10
cDELETE "TEST2" \ (* delete TEST2 if it exists.
c10 ON ERROR
```
```
cCREATE #PATH,"TEST2":WRITE \(* create TEST2.
cBASE 0
```
```
cFOR T=0 TO 9
cREAD RECORD(T) \ (* Read data lines into RECORD array.
cNEXT T
```
```
cSEEK #PATH,0 \ (* set pointer to beginning of file.
cPUT #PATH,RECORD \ (* store the entire array into the
file.
cCLOSE #PATH \ (* close path to the file.
```
```
cOPEN #PATH,"TEST2":READ \ (* open the file to read.
cFOR T=0 TO 9
cSEEK #PATH, LENGTH*T \ (* find each element.
cGET #PATH,LINE \ (* read an element.
cPRINT LINE \ (* print the element.
cNEXT T
```

```
Disk Files | 8
```
```
cCLOSE #PATH
cEND
```
```
cDATA "This is test line #1"
cDATA "This is test line #2"
cDATA "This is test line #3"
cDATA "This is test line #4"
cDATA "This is test line #5"
cDATA "This is test line #6"
cDATA "This is test line #7"
cDATA "This is test line #8"
cDATA "This is test line #9"
cDATA "This is test line #10"
```
This procedure reads the 10 lines into an array named RECORD. Then it places the
entire array in the TEST1 file, using one PUT statement. To show that the structure
of the file is still the same, the original FOR/NEXT loop reads the lines, one at a
time, and displays them.

Notice that, because you need to write only one element, you can set the file
pointer to 0 (SEEK #PATH,0). You can rewind a file pointer (set it to 0) at any
time in this manner.

You could save additional programming space by also reading the 10 lines back
into memory as an array. The following procedure uses a new array, READLINES,
to call the file back into memory, and displays the lines.

```
PROCEDURE arrayread
cBASE 0
cDIM READLINES(10):STRING[25]
cDIM PATH:BYTE
cOPEN #PATH,"TEST2":READ \ (* open file.
cGET #PATH,READLINES \ (* read file into array.
cCLOSE #PATH
cFOR T=0 TO 9
cPRINT READLINES(T) \ (* print each element of the array.
cNEXT T
cEND
```
**Using Complex Data Structures**

In the previous section, you stored and retrieved elements of an array that were all
the same size, 25 characters. Often you need to store elements of varying sizes,
such as when you create a data base program with several fields in one record.


**_Basic09 Reference_**

The following examples create a simple inventory system that requires a random
access file having 100 records. Each record includes the name of the item (a 25-
byte string), the item’s list price and cost (both real numbers), and the quantity on
hand (an integer).

First, you use the TYPE command to define a new data type that describes such a
record. For example:

```
TYPE INV_ITEM=NAME:STRING[25]; L1ST,COST:REAL;
QTY: INTEGER
```
Although this statement describes a new record type called INV_ITEM, it does not
assign variable storage for the record. The next step is to create two data structures:
an array of 100 records of type INV_ITEM named INV_ARRAY and a working
record named WORK_REC. The following lines do this:

```
DIM INV_ARRAY(188):INV_ITEM
DIM WORK_REC: INV_ITEM
```
To determine the number of bytes assigned for each type, you can use BASIC09’s
SIZE command. SIZE returns the number of bytes assigned to any variable, array,
or complex data structure. For example, the instruction SIZE(WORK_REC)
returns the number 37. The instruction S1ZE(INV_ARRAY) returns the number
3700.

You can use SIZE with SEEK to position a file pointer to a specific record’s
address.

The following procedure creates a file called inventory and immediately initializes
it with zeroes and nulls strings. Five INPUT lines then ask you for a record number
and the data to store in each field of the record. You can fill any record you choose,
from 1 through 100,

When one record is complete, the procedure uses PUT to store the record. Then, it
asks you for a new record number. If you wish to quit, enter a number either larger
than 100 or smaller than 1.


```
Disk Files | 8
```
```
PROCEDURE inventory
cREM Create a data type consisting of a 25-character
cREM name field, a real list price field, a real cost field,
cREM and an integer quantity field.
```
```
cTYPE INV_ITEM=NAME:STRING[25]; LIST,COST:REAL; QTY: INTEGER
cDIM INV_ARRAY(100):INV_ITEM \ (* dimension an array using new
type.
cDIM WORK_REC:INV_ITEM
cREM dimension a working variable of the new type.
cDIM PATH:BYTE
```
```
cON ERROR GOTO 10
cDELETE "inventory"
c10 ON ERROR
```
```
cCREATE #PATH,"inventory" \ (* create a file named inventory.
cWORK_REC.NAME ="" \ (* set all data elements to null or 0.
cWORK_REC.LIST=0
cWORK_REC.COST=0
cWORK_REC.QTY=0
cFOR N=1 TO 100
cPUT #PATH,WORK_REC
cNEXT N
```
```
cLOOP
cINPUT "Record number? ",RNUM \ (* enter number of record to
write.
cIF RNUM<1 OR RNUM>100 THEN \ (* check if number is valid.
cPRINT
cPRINT "End of Session" \ (* if not, end session.
cPRINT
cCLOSE #PATH
cEND
cENDIF
cINPUT "Item name? ",WORK_REC.NAME \(* type data for record.
cINPUT "List price? ",WORK_REC.LIST
cINPUT "Cost price? ",WORK_REC.COST
cINPUT "Quantity? ",WORK_REC.QTY
cSEEK #PATH, (RNUM-1)*SIZE(WORK_REC) \ (* find record.
cPUT #PATH,WORK_REC \ (* write record to file.
cENDLOOP
```
Notice that the INPUT statements reference each field separately, but the PUT
statement references the record as a whole.


**_Basic09 Reference_**

The next procedure lets you read any record in your inventory file, and displays
that record. If you ask for a record you have not yet filled with meaningful data,
the display consists of a null string and zeroes.

```
PROCEDURE readinv
cTYPE INV_ITEM=NAME:STRING[25]; LIST,COST:REAL; QTY:INTEGER
cDIM WORK_REC:INV_ITEM
cDIM PATH:BYTE
cOPEN #PATH, "inventory":READ
cLOOP
cINPUT "Record number to display? ",RNUM
cIF RNUM<1 OR RNUM>100 THEN
cPRINT "End of Session"
cPRINT
cCLOSE #PATH
cEND
cENDIF
cSEEK #PATH, (RNUM-1)*SIZE(WORK_REC)
cGET #PATH,WORK_REC
cPRINT "#","Item","List Price","Cost Price","Quantity"
cPRINT
"-------------------------------------------------------------------
--------"
cPRINT RNUM, WORK_REC.NAME, WORK_REC.LIST, WORK_REC.COST,
WORK_REC.QTY
cPRINT
cENDLOOP
cEND
```
This procedure accesses the file one record at a time. It is not necessary to do so.
You can read the entire file into memory at once by dimensioning an inventory
array and getting the whole file into it:

```
cTYPE INV_ITEM=NAME:STRING[25]; LIST,COST:REAL; QTY:INTEGER
cDIM INV_ARRAY(100):INV_ITEM
cSEEK #PATH,0 \ (* rewind the file.
cGET #PATH, INV_ARRAY
```
The examples in this section are simple, yet they illustrate the combined power of
BASIC09 complex data structures and the random access file statements. They
show that a single GET or PUT statement can move any amount of data, organized
in any way you want. Other advantages of using complex data structures are:

```
 The procedures are self-documenting. You can see easily what a procedure
does because its structures can have descriptive names.
 Execution is extremely fast.
```

```
Disk Files | 8
```
 Procedures are simple and usually require fewer statements to perform IO
functions than other BASICs.

 The procedures are versatile. By creating appropriate data structures, you
can read or write almost any kind of data from any file, including files
created by other programs or languages.


**Chapter 9**

**Displaying Text and Graphics**

BASIC09 has three levels of graphics capabilities. The first (low resolution) and
third (high resolution) levels can include both graphics designs and text. The
second (medium resolution) level can display only graphics designs.

NitrOS-9/EOU introduced new versions of the Inkey, SysCall, GFX and GFX2
subroutine modules. They replace the first character of the module name with the
letter **B**. These versions are merged with the BASIC09 module and are intended for
use during application development. They can be used until your procedure(s)
reach 32K of workspace. After that, you will have to rename your RUN statements
for these subroutines back to their original names and begin packing the
procedures to use with RunB. The originally named subroutines are merged with
RunB, so when you pack the procedures you can use them with RunB.

**Examples:**

```
RUN BFX("CLEAR")
RUN BFX2("GCOLR",xcor,ycor,color)
RUN BNKEY(key)
RUN BYSCALL(callCode,regs)
```
To change all occurrences of these to their original names:

```
c*/BFX/GFX/
c*/BFX2/GFX2/
c*/BNKEY/INKEY/
c*/BYSCALL/SYSCALL/
```
You _must_ return to the top of the procedure (using the -* command) for each of
these commands in order to ensure all occurrences of each are properly changed.
You only need to use the commands for the subroutines you used in a given
procedure.


**_Basic09 Reference_**

**ASCII Codes**

There are some keys which do not exist on a Color Computer keyboard. To remedy
this, Microware created some special key-mappings. They are listed here for your
convenience, as some of them ([,], and \) are used in BASIC09.

```
The back-tick, [SHIFT][@]. will show as a forward tick on a hardware text screen,
but properly as a backward tick on fonts that support it (including the standard
Tandy/Microware Group 200, font 1).

For low-resolution text screens and high-resolution text and graphic screens,
BASIC09 uses ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)
codes to represent the common alphanumeric characters. ASCII is the same code
that most small computers use.

There are times when you need to know the ASCII value of a printable character.
A table of the standard codes follows, showing decimal and hexadecimal values for
the common alphanumeric characters:

You can use the CHR$ function with the ASCII values of these characters to
produce the displayable character.

**Low-Resolution Graphic Characters**

In addition to alphanumeric characters, low-resolution graphics also offers graphic
characters. Generate these characters by pressing [ALT] at the same time you press
a keyboard character. The graphics character codes are in the range 128-255.

Pressing [ALT] while pressing another key, causes NitrOS-9 to add 128 to the
ASCII value of the second key. (For the technically minded, NitrOS-9 sets the high
bit of the character code.) Therefore, if you press [ALT][A], you produce graphics
character 193. You can also generate graphics characters from BASIC09 using the
CHRS$ function, and you can PRINT them in the same manner as other characters.

Low-level graphics characters follow a pattern that repeats every 16 characters.
Table 9.1 shows the first set of graphic characters, 128-143.


```
Displaying Text and Graphics | 9
```
```
Table 9.1
Low-Resolution Graphic Character Set
Character Code Character Code Character Code Character Code
```
Subsequent characters produce the same series of configurations but display in
different colors, as shown in Table 9.2.

```
Table 9.2

208 - 223 Black and Light Blue
224 - 239 Black and Cyan
240 - 254 Black and Orange
255 Green
```

**_Basic09 Reference_**

Within each color set, you can easily calculate the number for a particular
character. For instance, suppose you want to print a character that has orange upper
left and lower right corners. Picture the character divided into four sections,
numbered as follows:

To calculate a character that has orange at Sections 8 and 1, add the section values
to the first value in the orange group, 240, like this:

240 + 8 + 1 = 249

Character 249 is what you want.

The following diagram shows how you might block out a large letter O on the
screen. The shaded portions of the characters are colored. The unshaded portions
are black. In this case we want the colored portions to be green (the same color as
the screen). You can do this using the color set 128 - 143.


```
Displaying Text and Graphics | 9
```
Because Section 1 in the upper left character is to be colored, add 1 to the initial
character value of 128. The first character value is 129. Moving right, Sections 2
and 1 are colored in the second character. Add 3 to 128 to get a second character
value of 131. Calculate all 15 characters in this manner.

You could create a letter O in a BASIC09 procedure by printing each of the five
rows of three characters. You could use DATA lines to store the ASCII codes for
each character, then use loops to read and display the characters they represent.

Although low-level graphics is very rough, it can be useful, and it lets you mix
graphics with text.

The following procedure not only creates the letter O, it adds the letter S and the
number 9 to display the name of your operating system.

**Special Characters in High-Resolution**

High-resolution graphics does not have graphic characters but it does have other
international and special characters. These characters are represented by ASCII
codes 128 through 159 as shown in the following table:

**Medium-Resolution Graphics**

For more sophisticated graphics operations, NitrOS-9 has built-in graphics
interface modules that provide a convenient way to access the graphics and
joystick functions of the Color Computer 3. The required module for medium-
resolution graphics is named GFX. It must be in your execution directory or
resident in memory when called by BASIC09. The GFX module is for Level One
functions, and requires running on a VDG style (32x16) window. (JOYSTK is a
special case in that it will work on any type of window.)

You can either install GFX in memory using the LOAD command, or wait until
BASIC09 calls it for a graphics function. Once loaded, GFX resides in memory
until you remove it using the NitrOS-9 UNLINK command or the BASIC09 KILL
command.

GFX has a number of functions that you pass to it as parameters with the RUN
statement. For instance, the following statement clears the current graphics screen:

```
RUN GFX('CLEAR")
```

```
Displaying Text and Graphics | 9
```
Other tasks need such parameters as position, color, and size. The following is a
quick reference to all of the GFX functions. Each is explained in detail later:

```
Function Purpose Parameters
ALPHA Sets the screen to the alphanumeric mode. None.
CIRCLE Draws a circle. Radius, optional X- and Y-
coordinates, and color.
CLEAR Clears the screen to a color. Optional color for screen.

background colors.
FILL Fills (paints) foreground color starting at
current Graphics cursor address. Fills any
adjacent pixels that are the same color as the
pixel the Fill starts at.
```
```
None
```
```
GCOLR Reads a pixel’s color. Names of variables in
which to store optional X-
and Y-coordinates.
GLOC Returns a video display address. INTEGER variable that it
returns the screen address
in.
JOYSTK Returns the joystick button and X- and Y-
coordinate status.
```
```
Names of variables in
which to return the values.
LINE Draws a line. Ending X- and Y-
coordinates, optional
beginning coordinates,
optional color.
MODE Switches the screen between alphanumeric
and graphics, sets the graphics screen color.

```
```
None.
```
**Formats and Colors**

In medium-resolution graphics, you have a choice of two formats. Format 0
provides 256 horizontal points by 192 vertical points. In this format, you can have
only two colors on the screen at a time.

Format 1 provides a 128 by 192 point screen and a maximum of four colors on the
screen at a time. NitrOS-9 medium-resolution graphics treats the screen as if it


**_Basic09 Reference_**

were a grid, with coordinate 0,0 at the lower left corner as shown in the following
illustration. All points on the grid are positive.

BASIC09 defines colors with numbers or color codes. Many GFX functions allow
or require color codes as parameters. BASIC09 also divides the color codes into
color sets. Specifying a color code outside the current color set automatically
initializes the new set.

Use the preceding charts to choose colors for those functions that let you specify
foreground or background colors. For instance, to initialize a Format 1 graphics
screen with a green background and a red foreground, you type:

```
run gfx("mode",1,3)
```
The following reference section describes all the medium-resolution graphics
functions, and provides examples and sample programs. To understand the
organization of the commands reference, see "The Syntax Line" in Chapter 11.

**The Draw Pointer**

Medium-resolution graphics uses a draw pointer, or invisible graphics cursor, to
determine what area of the screen is affected by graphics operations. When you
establish a graphics screen, the draw pointer is located at coordinates 0,0. Some
graphic functions automatically change the pointer location on the screen, For
instance, the LINE function moves the draw pointer from the beginning
coordinates to the end coordinates.


**_Basic09 Reference_**

Because some functions begin at the draw pointer, you need to keep track of its
location and make certain it is placed properly. Use the MOVE function to set the
draw pointer to new locations.

**ALPHA Select alphanumeric screen**

**Syntax: RUN GFX("ALPHA")**

**Function:** Switches from the graphics screen to the alphanumeric (text) screen.
The current graphics screen remains intact.

**Parameters:**

```
None
```
**Examples:**

```
RUN GFX("ALPHA")
```
**Sample Procedure:**

This procedure lets you choose to draw a circle or rectangle of the size you select.
Once you choose the shape and size, it uses the MODE function to select a
graphics screen. When the shape is complete, you press [ENTER] to return to a
text screen. The procedure uses the ALPHA function to return to the original
menu.

**CIRCLE Draw a circle**

**Syntax: RUN GFX("CIRCLE"[,xcor,ycor],radius [,color])**

**Function:** Draws a circle of a given radius. If you do not specify a color, BASIC09
uses the current foreground color. If you do not specify X- and Y-coordinates,
CIRCLE uses the current graphics cursor position as the circle’s center.

**Parameters:**

```
radius The radius of the circle you want to draw.
color The code of the color you want the circle to be.
See the chart earlier in this section for color information.
xcor,ycor The X- and Y-coordinates for the center of the circle.
Specifying coordinates outside the X-coordinate range of
0-255 or outside the Y-coordinate range of 0-199 causes an
error.
```
**Examples:**

```
RUN GFXC"CIRCLE",100)
RUN GFX("CIRCLE",100,3)
RUN GFXC"CIRCLE",125,100,100)
RUN GFX("CIRCLE",125,100,100,2)
```
**Sample Procedure:**

This procedure uses CIRCLE to draw and erase a circle. The location of the circle
changes before each draw/erase operation, causing the circle to move. When it hits
the edge of the screen, it reverses its direction at a random angle and _bounces_.

**GLOC Find the graphics screen location**

**Syntax: RUN GFX("GLOC",storage)**

**Function:** Determines the location of the graphics screen in memory and returns
the address in the specified variable. When you know the graphic screen address,
you can use PEEK and POKE to perform special functions not available in the
GFX module, such as filling a portion of the screen with a color or saving a
graphics screen to disk.

NitrOS-9 Level Two maps display screens into a procedure’s address space before
PEEK and POKE can operate on a display screen. This means that you must have
at least eight kilobytes of free memory in the user’s address space. Procedure and
data memory requirements must not exceed 56 kilobytes.

**Parameters:**

```
storage An integer type variable in which GLOC stores the memory
address that the screen is mapped in at in the current process
(assuming a VDG
text or Coco 1/2 graphics screen).
```
**Examples:**

```
RUN GFX("GLOC",location)
```
**Sample Procedure:**

This procedure uses the GLOC function to locate the current graphics screen, then
uses POKE to paint a series of boxes on the screen.

**JOYSTK Get joystick status**

**Syntax: RUN GFX("JOYSTK",stick,fire,xcor,ycor)**

**Function:** Determines the status of the specified joystick fire button and the X,Y
position of the specified joystick handle. Use this function only with a standard
joystick or mouse, not with the high-resolution mouse adapter. If you want to make
a procedure that will be single button driven (and will work under both Level One
and Level Two), you should check the button status for 0 (no buttons pressed) or
<>0 (at least one button pressed).

**Parameters:**

```
stick The joystick (0 or 1) for which you want to determine the
status.
0 indicates the right joystick, 1 indicates the left joystick.
fire A variable in which JOYSTK returns the status of the specified
fire button. Fire can be byte, integer, or boolean type. Under
Level One, a value of $FF or TRUE indicates the button is
pressed. Under Level Two, it can return values of 1,2 or 3, with
the following meanings:
```
```
 1=Button 1 pressed
 2=Button 2 pressed
 3=Both buttons pressed
xcor,ycor Byte or integer type variables in which JOYSTK stores the X-
and Y-coordinates of the joystick handle position. The
coordinate range is 0-63.

**MODE Switch to graphics screen**

**Syntax: RUN GFX("MODE",format,color)**

**Function:** Switches the screen from alphanumeric (text) to graphics, selecting the
screen format and color code. You must run MODE before you can use any other
graphics function. When you do, BASIC09 allocates a six-kilobyte block of
memory for graphics. If your system does not have this amount of memory
available, NitrOS-9 returns an error message.

**Parameters:**

```

**_Basic09 Reference_**

**High-Resolution Graphics**

BASIC09’s high-resolution graphics greatly expand the capabilities of the Color
Computer 3. You can have greater screen resolution (up to 640 by 200 pixels), as
many as 64 colors, and the ability to mix graphics and text on one screen. In
addition, you can use different text fonts, or styles.

All drawing commands are faster if the text and graphics cursors are OFF at the
time they are executed. So if you want to draw a screen using drawing commands
and then have a mouse cursor and/or text cursor for interacting with the user, shut
the cursors off, do the main drawing, and then turn them back on.

The high-resolution module, GFX2, has many more functions than its medium
resolution counterpart. GFX2 gives you the ability to:

```
 Select from 64 colors. NitrOS-9 provides a palette with 16 default colors.
You can change any of these default colors to any of the 64 colors available
on the Color Computer 3.
 Set border colors.
 Set color patterns.
 Create different types of graphics screen cursors.
 Use logic functions.
 Turn an automatic scaling function off or on.
 Draw outline or filled boxes.
 Draw ellipses and arcs.
 Fill specified areas with specified colors.
 GET and PUT sections of the graphics screen.
 Select character fonts, which include boldfaced, transparent, and
proportionally spaced characters.
 Move the cursor. Erase portions of a line or of the screen.
 Select reverse or normal video.
 Underline text.
```
Also, high-resolution graphics operate through the NitrOS-9 Windowing System.
This means that you can run several procedures in different windows. You can
establish windows to display text, or to display graphics, or both. You can easily
display any window.


```
Displaying Text and Graphics | 9
```
**Establishing a Hardware Window**

For your convenience, NitrOS-9 has a number of predefined or hardware window
formats. Hardware windows are text windows, and you cannot use them for
graphic applications. Because hardware windows are predefined, you can easily
establish them with the INIZ command. For instance, to establish Window 7, type:

```
iniz /w7[ENTER]
```
However, you cannot see the window until you send a message to it. Type:

```
echo Hello Window 7 > /w7[ENTER]
```
Now, to see the window and your message press [CLEAR]. To return to the
original screen, press [CLEAR] again.

To NitrOS-9, a window is a device and you can send data to it. To view the Errmsg
file in the SYS directory of your system diskette, list it to Window 7 by typing:

```
list sys/errmsg > /w7[ENTER]
```
to move to Window 7 and see the listing. Press [SHIFT][CLEAR] to return to the
previous screen.

You can also fork a shell (an execution environment) to a window. To cause a shell
to operate in window 7, type:

```
shell i=/w7&[ENTER]
```
The i= function of SHELL tells NitrOS-9 that the window is _immortal_. It does not
die after completing a task. To operate NitrOS-9 from the window, press
[CLEAR].

Besides window 7, you have six other predefined windows. The following chart
shows all the hardware windows and their parameters:

```
Starting
Coordinate
s
Window Screen Size X-Coord, Window Size
Number Chars/line Y-Coord Cols Rows
1 80 0,0 80 25
2 80 0,0 80 25
3 80 0,0 80 25
4 80 0,0 80 25
5 80 0,0 80 25
```

**_Basic09 Reference_**

```
6 80 0,0 80 25
7 80 0,0 80 25
```
The /TERM window can be set in /dd/sys/env.file, by changing the settings for
CONDVTYP, CONXSIZ, CONYSIZ, CONFCLR, CONBCLR, and CONBDCLR,
and this will change /TERM's setting as NitrOS-9 boots.

**Defining Windows**

As well as hardware windows, NitrOS-9 also lets you establish windows to your
own specifications. You can set definable windows for either text or graphics, or
both. You can locate them anywhere on a screen, and you can make them any size.

You initialize definable windows in the same manner you initialize hardware
windows, using INIZ. If you want to have text on the window, you must merge
SYS/Stdfonts (found on your system diskette) with the window (NitrOS-9/EOU
pre-loads these fonts for you on boot). You can also establish a shell in a definable
window, from which you can use NitrOS-9 or BASIC09.

To establish definable windows you must supply NitrOS-9 with information about
the type of window you want (its graphic format), its size, and its location on the
screen. The easiest way to do this is with the NitrOS-9 WCREATE command.

WCREATE requires a window format code in the form -s= _format code_ to tell
NitrOS-9 what type of a window you want. The following chart shows the possible
window formats you can choose:

† You have to reconfigure the palette to get 16 colors rather than the default of eight colors. The
following section provides information on the palette.
```

**_Displaying Text and Graphics_** **|** **_9_**


**_Basic09 Reference_**

Format Codes 01 and 02 select text screens, and Format Codes 5-8 select graphics
screens. The Screen Size column shows the maximum number of text columns and
rows available for each screen. The Resolution column shows the maximum _pixels_
(graphic units) available for each of the graphic screens. The Memory column
shows how much memory NitrOS-9 must set aside for each screen format.
Memory requirements depend on the resolution and number of colors selected for a
window.

**The Palette**

BASIC09 has 64 colors you can select for screen displays. The colors are available
through a palette. The Color Computer’s palette can hold 16 colors at once.

The following chart shows the default colors for the palette in Screen Format 7:

```
Table 9.6
Register Color Register Color
00 Black 08 Black
01 Red 09 Green
02 Green 10 Black
03 Yellow 11 Buff
04 Blue 12 Black
05 Magenta 13 Green
06 Cyan 14 Black
07 White 15 Orange
```
Instead of the default colors, you can select any of the 64 colors (0-63) for any of
the palette registers. You do this using the PALETTE command described later in
this chapter. The BORDER and COLOR commands also affect the colors available
in the palette by changing the color in the background and foreground registers,
Registers 02 and 03, respectively.

```
Note: The information in the next section assumes you have a Color
Computer 3 with 512 kilobytes of memory. If your computer has 128
kilobytes of memory, skip to the section “High-Level Graphics With
128K.”
```

```

```
**Establishing a Graphics Window**

To create any window, you should first initialize it with the INIZ command. Type:

iniz w1

If you are not running NitrOS9 EOU, you will need to merge at least stdfonts to
any window in order to see text. To do so, type:

```
merge sys/stdfonts>/w1
```
Using the information in the preceding tables, use WCREATE to establish a
graphics window. The following command line creates a graphics window in
Window 1 that has 320 x 200 resolution and that fills the entire screen. The new
window has 16 colors available and provides 40 column by 25 line text:

```
wcreate /wl -s=8 00 00 40 25 03 02 02
| | | | | | | | | |
| | | | | | | | | +-> The screen border color
| | | | | | | | +----> The screen background color
| | | | | | | +-------> The screen foreground color
| | | | | | +----------> The screen height in rows
| | | | | +-------------> The screen width in columns
| | | | +----------------> The starting Y-Coordinate
| | | +-------------------> The starting X-coordinate
| | +-----------------------> The screen type
| +----------------------------> The window name
+-----------------------------------> The command name
```
**Starting a Shell in a Window**

At this point, the new window exists, and you can send data to it. However, if you
want to operate from the window, you must install a shell in it. Type:

```
shell 1=/w1&
```
Press [CLEAR] to move to the new window. To load BASIC09, type:

```
basic09 #18K
```
Select either more or less memory, according to your needs. Using BASIC09 in a
graphics window, you can write procedures to create high-resolution graphics, and
you can display the graphics on the same screen.


**_Basic09 Reference_**

**Using High-Level Graphics With 128K**

If your computer is equipped with only 128 kilobytes of memory, you cannot use
more than one window with BASIC09. Also, to use even one window, you must
follow certain steps to provide enough memory for BASIC09 operations.

Refer to Table 9.6. You must select a window mode that does not use more than
16000 bytes of memory—either window Format 5 or Format 6.

To provide enough memory to use BASIC09, you must fork a shell to the window
you create, then kill the shell in TERM. Doing this means that you can no longer
operate from your TERM screen. However, you can run NitrOS-9 and BASIC09
from the window.

The following steps show you how to create a Format 6 graphics screen in
Window 1, write a BASIC09 high-resolution graphics procedure, and execute it
using minimum memory.

1. Boot NitrOS-9. Then, create a graphics window by typing:
    iniz w1[ENTER]
    wcreate /w1 -s=06 00 00 40 24 06 01 01[ENTER]
    merge sys/stdfonts>/w1[ENTER]
    shell i=/w1&[ENTER]
    ex[ENTER]
2. The system stops, and you can no longer type or issue commands. Press
    [CLEAR] to move to the new window. Then, load BASIC09 by typing:
       basic09[ENTER]
3. Enter the edit mode, and type the following procedure:
    PROCEDURE squeeze
    cDIM XCOR,YCOR,X,Y:INTEGER; RESPONSE:STRING[1]
    cRUN GFX2("CUROFF")
    cXCOR=320 \ YCOR=95 \ X=300 \ FLAG=1
    cPRINT CHR$(12)
    cLOOP
    cFOR Y=1 TO 100 STEP 2
    cX=X-3
    cGOSUB 10
    cIF FLAG<1 THEN
    cRUN GFX2("COLOR",0)
    cELSE
    cRUN GFX2("COLOR",3)
    cENDIF
    cRUN GFX2("ELLIPSE",XCOR,YCOR,X,Y)
    cFLAG=FLAG*-1
    cNEXT Y
    cRUN GFX2("COLOR",0)
    cFOR Y=99 TO 1 STEP -2


```
Displaying Text and Graphics | 9
cGOSUB 10
cX=X+3
cRUN GFX2("ELLIPSE",XCOR,YCOR,X,Y)
cNEXT Y
cRUN GFX2("COLOR",0)
cENDLOOP
c10 RUN INKEY(RESPONSE)
cIF RESPONSE="" THEN
cRETURN
cENDIF
cPRINT CHR$(12)
cRUN GFX2("COLOR",9)
cRUN GFX2("CURON")
cEND
```
4. When you have entered the procedure exactly as shown, exit the edit mode,
    and from the BASICO9 command mode, save Squeeze by typing:
       save squeeze[ENTER]
5. Compile Squeeze by typing:
    pack squeeze[ENTER]
    Squeeze is now an executable module saved in your current execution
    directory. The following steps assume your execution directory is
    /D0/CMDS.
6. Exit BASIC09 by typing:
    bye[ENTER]
7. Merge Squeeze, RUNB, INKEY, and GFX2 into one module. To do this,
    type:
       merge /d0/cmds/squeeze /d0/cmds/runb
       /d0/cmds/inkey/d0/cmds/gfx2 >
       /d0/cmds/yawn[ENTER]
8. MERGE does not set the new file Yawn as an executable file. Before you
    execute it, you must make the file executable by typing:
       attr /d0/yawn e pe[ENTER]
9. To execute Yawn, type:\
    yawn
10.To terminate the procedure, press the space bar.


**_Basic09 Reference_**

The merging procedure in step 7 saves a considerable amount of memory. Every
module you load uses one or more 8-kilobyte blocks of storage space. For instance,
INKEY is only 94 bytes in length, However, if you load it as a separate module, it
requires 8192 bytes. RUNB is 12185 bytes in length. This means that it requires
two 8-kilobyte blocks, or 16384 bytes of memory. GFX2 is 2190 bytes in length,
and Squeeze is 605 bytes in length. Loaded individually, they also require two
memory blocks.

If you load all four modules independently, they use 40960 bytes. However, by
combining them into one file, they load into two memory blocks, or 16384 bytes.

Using the information in this section, you can write and execute numerous
BASIC09 procedures with only 128 kilobytes of memory. However, if your
computer has 512 kilobytes of memory, you can bypass many of these steps. Also,
the additional memory enables you to have several windows open at one time. For
instance, you can create one window in which to write BASIC09 procedures,
another window in which to execute your procedures, and a third window from
which you can use NitrOS-9 commands.

```
Note: The remainder of this chapter assumes you have at least 512
kilobytes of memory. If you don’t, you can still run many of the
sample procedures by implementing the steps in this section.
```
**Creating Windows from BASIC09**

Using GFX2 routines, BASIC09 provides the means to create and manage
windows. The steps for creating windows from BASIC09 are as follows:

1. DIM a variable to hold the path number to the window you want to create.
2. OPEN a path to the window.
3. SELECT the new window as the display window.
4. Send commands, data, or text to the window through the open path.
5. CLOSE the open path.
6. Use SELECT to return to your original window.

If you do not want to return immediately to the screen or window of origin, you
can skip Steps 5 and 6.

The following sample procedure shows how to open the next available window as
a 320 x 192 graphics window, draw a circle, then return to the original screen when
you press a key.


```
Displaying Text and Graphics | 9
PROCEDURE make_win
cDIM PATH:INTEGER
cDIM RESPONSE:STRING[1]
cOPEN #PATH,"/W":WRITE
cRUN GFX2(PATH,"DWSET",08,00,00,40,24,03,02,02)
cRUN GFX2(PATH,"SELECT")
cRUN GFX2(PATH,"CIRCLE",200,90,80)
cGET #1,RESPONSE
cCLOSE #PATH
cRUN GFX2("SELECT")
cEND
```
This procedure establishes a Format 8 window, beginning at coordinates 0,0 and
covering the total screen. The foreground color is green, the background color is
black, and the border color is black.

Because this procedure does not INIZ the window it opens, the window
automatically disappears when the procedure closes its path. To create a window
that stays in the system, even after you close the path to it, use INIZ before the
OPEN statement, like this:

```
SHELL "INIZ /W2"
```
After you create and define the window, view it by pressing [CLEAR]. To get
back to the screen you are working on, press [SHIFT][CLEAR]. If you intend to
use a window more than once in a procedure, you do not need to close its path until
the procedure no longer needs it.

**Creating Overlay Windows**

When you establish a window, you are initializing an NitrOS-9 device. However,
an overlay window is only a new screen for an existing window. An overlay screen
can be the same size as its window, or it can be smaller. NitrOS-9 automatically
transfers to the overlay window any current procedures operating in the device
window.

The process for creating overlay windows lets you select whether you want to save
the contents of the screen covered by the new window. If you choose to save the
contents, the previous screen is redisplayed when you end the overlay.

The following procedure provides an example of using overlay windows. It creates
six overlays, each smaller than the preceding window. The procedure then waits
for you to press a key. When you do, it removes the overlay windows.


**_Basic09 Reference_**

```
PROCEDURE overwindows
cDIM X,Y,X1,Y1,T,J,B,L,PLACE:INTEGER
cDIM RESPONSE:STRING[1]

**The Graphics Cursor and the Draw Pointer**

High-resolution graphics provide a text cursor, a graphics cursor, and a _draw
pointer_. The text cursor and the graphics cursor can be either visible or invisible.

#### The Draw Pointer 9-

Text functions always begin at the current location of the text cursor. Whenever
you _print_ on the screen, the cursor automatically moves to the end of the text or to
the beginning of the next line, depending on whether or not you use a semicolon
after the print statement. You can reset the text cursor to any place on the screen
with the CURXY function of GFX2.

Many BASIC09 graphics functions also begin operating at a location pointed to by
the draw pointer. When you begin graphics, the draw pointer is located at
coordinates 0,0. BASIC09 then updates the pointer as you execute certain graphics
functions. For instance, the LINE function of GFX2 draws from the draw pointer
position to the specified end coordinates. The draw pointer is left pointing to the
end coordinates.

Because some functions begin at the draw pointer, you need to keep track of its
location and make certain it is placed properly. Use the SETDPTR function to
move the draw pointer to new locations.

The graphics cursor is for use with joystick or mouse operations. It provides a
_pointer_ for graphics applications. The system diskette provides patterns that can be
loaded into the graphics cursor _buffer_. You can select from a variety of pointer
images.

**High-Resolution Text**

When you create a graphics window, you can display either text characters,
graphics characters, or both.

To display graphics, move the draw pointer to the location where you want the
graphics to begin. Then, execute the graphics routines.

To display text, move the text cursor to the location where you want the text to
begin. Then, use normal BASIC commands to _print_ text.

Instructions for the draw pointer relate to a 640 x 200 grid, numbered 0-639 and 0-

199. Instructions for the text cursor relate to the number of characters per line and
the number of lines on the current screen format.


**_Basic09 Reference_**

**Using Fonts**

NitrOS-9 Level Two includes fonts (character sets) that are stored in the SYS
directory on the system diskette and must be manually merged before you can use
them. NitrOS-9 EOU includes many fonts that are pre-loaded and are available for
use at startup. You can also create your own fonts and instruct BASIC09 to use
them. If you create your own fonts, you can design any symbols or graphics
characters you want to use.

To use fonts, you must be in a graphics window. See "Establishing a Graphics
Screen" earlier in this chapter. Use the FONT function to tell NitrOS-9 what font
you want. The fonts are installed in group 200. The following procedure uses
characters installed in group 200, buffers 1, 2, and 3, using the font in buffer 3 to
draw a border, then prints a message using the characters in buffer 2. It then returns
to buffer 3 and asks you to press a key to end the procedure.

**High-Resolution Quick Reference**

High-resolution functions are all part of the GFX2 module. You call them in a
BASIC09 procedure with the following syntax:

```
RUN GFX2([PATH,]"FUNCTION"[,PARAMETER[,...]])
```
_Path_ is an optional variable name that tells NitrOS-9 the window in which you
want the function performed. _Function_ is the high-resolution task you want to
perform. _Parameter_ is an essential or optional value that affects the performance of
the function. Different functions require or permit different numbers of parameters.

The following reference gives a brief description of the high-resolution graphics
functions, followed by a detailed description of each function.


**_Basic09 Reference_**

**Window Functions**

```
Function Description
CWArea Changes the size of a window. You can only reduce the working
area of a window, not increase it.
DWEnd Deallocates an established window.
DWProtectSw Lets you unprotect a window and set other device windows over it.
This might destroy the contents of either or both windows.
DWSet Establishes a window and sets its location on the screen, its size,
its background color, its foreground color, and its border color.
GetSel Returns menu selection
Menu Set window menus for high level menu handler
Item Set pulldown items for high level menu handler
OWEnd Deallocates the specified overlay window.
OWSet Establishes an overlay window on a device window that already
exists. The function also sets the overlay window size, back-
ground color, foreground color, and border color. When using this
function, you can choose whether or not to save the contents of the
original screen.
SBar Update scroll bars
Select Selects the window to display.
Title Set window title & sizes for high level menu handler
UMBar Update menu bar
WInfo Returns window information
WnSet Set high level window type (this is different than basic windows
types which set resolution and color depth; these define window
types like framed, outlined, etc.)
```

```

```
**CWAREA Change working area**

**Syntax: RUN GFX2([path,]"CWAREA",xcor,ycor,sizex,sizey)**

**Function:** Restricts output in the window to the specified area. The new area must
be the same or smaller than the previous working area. When a window’s working
area is changed, NitrOS-9 scales graphic and text coordinates and graphic images
to the new proportions _if the Scaling switch is turned on_. Text characters remain
the same size. The xcor,ycor,sizex and sizey parameters are always based on 8x8
pixel fonts, even if a 6x8 pixel font is currently selected.

**Parameters:**

```
path The route to the window in which you want to change the
working area.
xcor,ycor The beginning coordinates (the upper left corner) for the new
working area, relative to the original window. The coordinates
are based on the character column and row size of the original
window.
sizex Designates the number of columns in the new working area.
sizey The number of lines available in the new working area.
```
**Examples:**

```
RUN GFX2("CWAREA",10,0,40,10)
```
**Sample Procedure:**

This procedure makes the working area in a window progressively smaller, filling
each area with a different color. It then changes the areas’ colors rapidly to produce
a hypnotic effect.

**DWEND Device window end**

**Syntax: RUN GFX2([path,]"DWEND")**

**Function:** Deallocates the device window you initialized with DWSET and INIZ.
If the window deallocated is the last device window on the screen, BASIC09
returns the screen memory to the system. DWEND automatically positions you in
the next device window, a result similar to pressing [CLEAR]. You can use this
function with DWSET to redefine a device window to a different type.

**Parameters:**

```
path The path number of the window you wish to end.
Path can be a constant or variable.
```
**Examples:**

RUN GFX2("DWEND")
RUN GFX2(PATH,"DWEND")
RUN GFX2(3,"DWEND")
**Sample Procedure:**

From /TERM, this procedure temporarily opens a path to Window 3, displays the
new window, draws a design, then returns to the /TERM screen and closes the
path.

**DWPROTSW Device window protect switch**

**Syntax: RUN GFX2([path,]"DWPROTSW","switch")**

**Function:** Lets you _unprotect_ one device window and set other device windows on
top of it.

NitrOS-9 on the Color Computer 3 normally uses a protected windowing system
that does not allow window devices to overlap. Removing the window protection
with DWPROTSW lets one device window exist on the same screen area as
another window device. Because this might destroy the contents of an unprotected
window, you need to use care with this function.

As an example, GSHELL uses this to allow you to open other device windows on
top of the main window, such as when you select the Clock app from the Tandy
menu.

The "bottom device window" that GShell creates covers the entire screen and stays
unprotected. Any sizable applications the user picks (like Clock) have their
sizing/placement box put on this underlying screen, moved around and sized by the
mouse, and once the position and size of the window is locked in, it creates a new
device window in that space on top of the unprotected one. More applications can
be placed on this same screen, with the position and size of each one shown by
drawing on the unprotected window underneath them all.

**Parameters:**

```
path The route to the window you want to unprotect.
switch Either OFF to turn off protection, or ON to turn on protection.
The default is ON.
```
**Examples:**

```
RUN GFX2("DWPROTSW",OFF)
RUN GFX2("DWPROTSW",ON)
```

**DWSET Device window set**

**Syntax: RUN GFX2([path,)“DWSET”,format,xcor,ycor,width,height,
foreground, background, border)**

**Function:** Defines a device window. Normally, you first open a path to a window,
then use DWSET to set the window format, location, size, and colors.

**Parameters:**

```
path The route to the window you are defining.
format The code for the type of screen you want to establish.
See Table 9.5 at the beginning of this section for the
formats available.
xcor,ycor The coordinates (character column and row) of the upper
left corner of
the screen you want to create.
width The width (in characters) of the new window.
height The height (in lines) of the new window.
foreground The code for the window's foreground color.
background The code for the window’s background color.
border The code for the window’s border color.
```
**Examples:**

```
RUN GFX2("DWSET",06,50,100,50,10,20,12,9)
```
**Sample Procedure:**

From /TERM, this procedure temporarily opens a path to the next free window,
creates the window format, and uses SELECT to display the new window, draws a
design, then returns to the /TERM screen, deallocates the window, and closes the
path.

**GETSEL Get menu selection or keypress from Multi-Vue menus**

**Syntax: RUN GFX2([path],"GETSEL",menu_id,menu_item)**

**Function:** Returns the menu number and menu item number (both will be 0 if
none was selected) from the Multi-Vue menu handler. If a key was pressed, this
can be determined by either an INKEY or an SS.Ready GetStat call. This is usually

**MENU Set window menus for high level menu handler**

**Syntax: RUN GFX2([path],"MENU",d_array,menunum,
menuname,menuid,xsize,numofitems,menu_array,enableflag)**

**Function:** Defines the Menus that will appear on the Menu bar. Part of the
MultiVue menu handler.

**Parameters:**

```
path The route to the window that contains the menu.
d_array The window descriptor array.
menunum Position of the drop down menu in the menu bar
(1 to number of menus on menu bar).
menuname Text name of the menu as it will appear on the menu bar.
menuid Menu ID number that will be returned to caller (Which
menu was dropped down and selected from). 1-32 are
reserved to be common ones between programs, some of
which are defined in the MultiVue manual. It is
recommended that non-general menu id's start at 33 (up to
a maximum of 127).
xsize Width of the pull down menu (in characters, not pixels).
numofitems Number of items in this pull down menu.
menu_array Array for this pull down menu.
enableflag 0=Entire pull down menu is disabled (not selectable),
1=pull down menu enabled (selectable).

**OWEND Overlay window end**

**Syntax: RUN GFX2([path,]"OWEND")**

**Function:** Closes an overlay window. The underlying device window settings are
preserved and changes done on the overlay window do not affect those original
settings. If the overlay window was created with save switch on (see **OWSET** ),
whatever was under the overlay window will be restored to the screen.

**Parameters:**

_path_ path is the path number of the overlay window you wish to end.
Path can be a constant or variable.

**Examples:**

```
RUN GFX2("OWEND")
RUN GFX2(PATH,"OWEND")
RUN GFX2(3,"OWEND")
```

**_Basic09 Reference_**

**OWSET Establish an overlay window**

**Syntax: RUN GFX2([path,]"OWSET",save switch,xpos,ypos,xsize,
ysize,foreground,background)**

**Function:** Creates an overlay window on a previously existing device window.
Reconfigures the current device window paths to use a new area of the screen as
the current device window. The underlying window settings are preserved and
changes to the overlay do not affect it.

**Parameters:**

```
path The route to the window in which you want to set an overlay.
save switch Either 0 or 1. A value of 0 tells BASIC09 not to save the
overlaid area. A value of 1 tells BASIC09 to save the overlaid
area and restore it when the new window closes.
xpos The character column in which to start the new window
(upper left corner)
ypos The character row in which to start the new window
(upper left corner).
xsize The width of the new window in characters.
ysize The height of the new window in rows.
foreground The foreground color of the new window.
background The background color of the new window.
```
**Examples:**

```
RUN GFX2("OWSET",00,44,10,32,8,00,06)
```
**Sample Procedure:**

This procedure creates six progressively smaller overlay windows, labeling each. It
then waits for you to press a key, after which it erases all the windows and leaves
the original window intact.

**SELECT Select window to view on screen**

**Syntax: RUN GFX2([path,]"SELECT")**

**Function:** SELECT causes a window to display if the procedure is operating in the
active window. If the procedure is not in the active window, the newly selected
window displays when you press [CLEAR]. If you do not specify a path, BASIC09
selects the device using the standard input, standard output, and standard error
paths, Paths 0, 1, and 2.

**Parameters:**

```
path The path to the window to select.
```
**Examples:**

```
RUN GFX2("SELECT")
RUN GFX2(1,"SELECT")
RUN GFX2(PATH,"SELECT")
```
**Sample Procedure:**

From /TERM, this procedure temporarily opens a path to the next free window,
creates the window format, and uses SELECT to display the new window, draws a
design, then returns to the /TERM screen, deallocates the window, and closes the
path.

```

**TITLE Sets up the main Multi-Vue style window descriptor**

**Syntax: RUN GFX2([path,],"TITLE",d_array,title$,xcolmin,ycolmin,
menucount)**

**Function:** Sets up the main window descriptor for Multi-Vue style windows, as
well as the window title (shown when not the active window), the minimum size
the window can be run in (by text columns/rows, which are 8x8 pixel chunks), and
the maximum number of user-defined menu bar drop down menus. Note that the
Close box is always present and does not need to be defined by the program and is
not included in this count.

**Parameters:**

```
path The route to the window that you are setting up a Multi-Vue
style window.
d_array The window descriptor array. It should be STRING[32] and the
array should be the maximum number of menu pull downs you
want +1 (i.e. 2 menu pulldowns should be DIM
wd(3):STRING).
title$ The title of the window. This will only display if the window is
not the current active window (has control of the keyboard and
mouse). Maximum 20 characters.
xcolmin The minimum size (in text columns) that the window can run
in.
ycolmin The minimum size (in text rows) that the window can run in.
menucount The number of menu pull downs that will appear on the menu
bar.
```
**Examples:**

```
RUN GFX2("TITLE",wd,"Tools",34,10,2)
```
**Sample Procedure:**
See the sample program for GETSEL.

**UMBAR Updates the menu bar, allowing enabling/disabling of menu
items or entire menus under program control. It also allows a program to do
its own pulldowns.**

**Syntax: RUN GFX2([path,],"UMBAR")**

**Function:** Updates the Menu bar and Menu pulldowns to change any
activated/deactivated that the program updated through the menu and item arrays.
If one makes a menu with no items, they can create their own dropdown using
OWSet, and enable/disable the menu bar menu entry when needed. MVCanvas
uses this for its Tools menu (which is all graphics and no text), for example.

**Parameters:**

```

**WNSET Actually sets the Multu-Vue window type (both with menus**

**and not)**

**Syntax: RUN GFX2([path,],"WNSET",wintype,d_array)**

**Function:** Actually draws the Multi-Vue style window. NOTE: You must have set
up your TITLE, MENU, and ITEM functions first (and the main window array) if
you are going to be using any type of framed window (with or without scroll bars).
You can also use WNSET on overlay windows as well. The window that WNSET
is going to be changing the appearance of must be already set up via DWSET or
OWSET as WNSET simply changes the existing window's appears for the Multi-
Vue window type that is desired.

**Parameters:**

```
path The route to the window that you are setting up a Multi-Vue
style window.
wintype The window frame type, from the table below. Only 1 and 2

**_Basic09 Reference_**

**ARC Draw an arc**

**Syntax:** RUN GFX2({path,)“ARC”[,mx,my],xrad,yrad,xcor1,ycor1,xcor2,
ycor2)

**Function:** Draws an arc at the current or specified draw position with the specified
X and Y radius. If you specify the same radius for both X and Y, the function
draws a circular arc, otherwise the arc is elliptical. The X coordinates are in the
range 0-639. The Y coordinates are in the range 0-199.

ARC begins drawing from the point on the screen closest to the first set of
coordinates (xcor1, ycor1). It stops at the portion of the screen closest to the
second set of coordinates (xcor2, ycor2). You can determine on which side of the
line ARC draws by selecting which set of coordinates is the beginning and which
set is the end.

**Parameters:**

```
path The route to the window in which you want to draw an arc.
mx,my The X- and Y-coordinates for the center of the arc. If you do
not specify mx and my, BASIC09 uses the current draw
pointer position.
xrad The radius of the arc’s width.
yrad The radius of the arc’s height.
xcor1 ycor1 The beginning and ending coordinates for an imaginary line
xcor2,ycor2 from which the function draws an arc. The line is relative to
the center of the arc (the center point is at 0,0 for these
coordinates) and extends through the two coordinates from
one edge of the screen to the other. Negative coordinates are
allowed.
```
**Examples:**

```
RUN GFX2("ARC",58,108,50,108,50,156)
```
**Sample Procedure:**
This procedure draws a series of diagonally-cut arcs on a graphics window screen.

option list. It allows an optional start location before the option list. The option list
is a string of characters and numbers. You can separate options with spaces or
commas or run them together. You must include commas between the two
coordinates for the B and U options and the optional start position.

**Parameters:**

```
path The route to the window in which you want to draw.
xcor,ycor Optional start coordinates. Sets the draw pointer to the
specified coordinates before drawing.
option list A string consisting of one or more of the following options:
```
```

S num draws south (down) num units.
E num draws east (right) num units.
W num draws west (left) num units.
NE num draws northeast (up and right) num units.
NW num draws northwest (up and left) num units.
SE num draws southeast (down and right) num units.
SW num draws southwest (down and left) num units.
A val rotates the draw axis. Possible values are:
```
1. = normal
2. = 90 degrees
3. = 180 degrees
4. = 270 degrees
U _xcor,ycor_ draws a relative vector to the specified coordinates.
Xcor and ycor are relative to the current draw
pointer position. The draw pointer location does not
change. Xcor and ycor must be separated by a
comma.
B _xcor,ycor_ produces a blank line (moves the cursor but does not
draw). The xcor and ycor coordinates are relative to
the current draw pointer location. If you specify
relative coordinates located offscreen, you cannot
see subsequent lines.

**GCSET Set graphics cursor**

**Syntax: RUN GFX2("GCSET",group,buffer)**

**Function:** Defines a buffer from which BASIC09 gets the graphics cursor. This
lets you define your own cursor for graphics operations. To turn the graphics
cursor off, use a group Number 0. You must execute this command to display a
graphics cursor. Before using GCSET, you must merge the Stdcur file in the SYS
directory to the window.

**NOTE:** The larger the graphics cursor is, the slower it will draw/redraw on the
screen. Also, for optimal speed, a graphics cursor should be the same color depth
as the screen it is running on. (a 2 color buffer for a 2 color screen, a 4 color buffer
for a 4 color screen, a 16 color buffer for a 16 color screen). Please note that the
standard graphics cursors in OS9/NitrOS9 are _only_ 2 color, so they will run a bit
slower on a 4 or 16 color screen.

**Parameters:**

```
group The group number of the buffer containing the cursor image to
use. See NitrOS-9 Windowing System for information on the
group to use.
buffer The number of the buffer that contains the cursor image to use.
See NitrOS-9 Windowing System for information on the buffer
to use.
```
**Examples:**

```
RUN GFX2("GCSET",1,5)

**LOGIC Perform logic function**

**Syntax: RUN GFX2("LOGIC","function")**

**Function:** Causes BASIC09 to perform the specified logic function on all data bits
used by subsequent drawing functions. Once set, the logic function remains in
effect until you turn LOGIC off.

**Parameters:**

```
function can be any of the following logical functions:
OFF — no logic
AND — performs AND logic
OR — performs OR logic
XOR — performs XOR logic
```
**Examples:**

```
RUN GFX2("LOGIC","AND")
RUN GFX2("LOGIC","XOR")
```

**PATTERN Select pattern buffer**

**Syntax: RUN GFX2([path,]"PATTERN",group,buffer)**

**Function:** Selects the contents of a preloaded Get/Put buffer as a pattern for
graphics functions. Although PATTERN can use a buffer of any size, it uses a
specific number of bytes, depending on the screen format in use:

```
Color
Mode
```
```
Pattern
Array Size
```
```
Bits
Per Pixel
02 4 bytes x 8 bytes = 32 bytes 1
04 8 bytes x 8 bytes = 64 bytes 2
16 16 bytes x 8 bytes = 128 bytes 4
```
The pattern array is a 32 x 8 pixel representation of graphics memory. It takes the
current color mode into consideration to define the number of bits per pixel and
pixels per byte. If the buffer is larger than the number of bytes required,
PATTERN ignores the extra bytes. BASIC09 uses the selected pattern with all
draw commands until you change the pattern or turn off the pattern function by
specifying a group and buffer number of 0.

**NOTE:** One should use patterns for the Color Mode that matches the screen type
that they are using to get the maximum speed. If they don't match, the graphics
driver has to do a pixel by pixel conversion for every drawing command that is
using the pattern, which is much slower. NitrOS9 EOU preloads the standard and
MVCanvas pattern buffers for all 3 color depths (2, 4 and 16 color).

**Parameters:**

```
path The route to the window in which you want to use a new
graphics pattern,
group The group number of the buffer you want to use for a graphics
pattern.
buffer The buffer number that you want to use for a graphics pattern.
```
**Examples:**

```
RUN GFX2("PATTERN",1,3)
```

**_Basic09 Reference_**

**Sample Procedure:**
This procedure loads the current window data at location 0,0 into a buffer to use as
a draw pattern. It then draws a circle and fills the circle with the pattern in the

**Get/Put Functions**

```
FunctionDescription
DefBuff Defines a buffer for storage
Get Saves a specified portion of a window to a buffer
GPLoad Preloads a buffer from a disk file
KillBuff Deallocates a buffer
Put Places the image stored in a buffer onto a window
```

**_Basic09 Reference_**

**DEFBUFF Define a GET/PUT buffer**

**Syntax: RUN GFX2("DEFBUFF",group,buffer,size)**

**Function:** Defines a buffer for GET/PUT operations and other purposes.

When you define a buffer, you do so by group number and buffer number. Each
buffer you define can allocate up to 48K (free RAM permitting). These buffers can
be mapped into a process space to be manipulated (assuming enough free space in
the process' RAM along with its program and data areas) that can then be used for
GET/PUT graphics, clipboards and other data storage. The system needs 30 bytes
overhead (buffer definitions) for GET/PUT buffers. Within the group, you can
allocate one or more buffers. Select a group number and a buffer number as
indicated in the following "Parameters" section. Use these numbers in future
references to the buffer.

A buffer remains allocated until you use the KILLBUFF function to remove it
from your system's memory. For more information on GET/PUT buffers, see
KILLBUFF, PUT, GET, and GPLOAD.

**Parameters:**

```
group A number you select in the range 1-199.
buffer A number (in the range 1-255) that you assign to the
buffer you create.
size The size of the buffer, in the range of 1 to 49152 bytes,
depending on available memory in your system.
NOTE: If the size is >32767, it will need to be specified in
hexadecimal format. Example: To make a buffer of 40000 bytes,
pass the size as '$9C40'.
```
**Notes:** One method of selecting a group number is to use the ID function to obtain
your user's process ID number. Then, use this ID number as the base group
number. A general guideline is that system wide buffers, such as fonts, mouse
cursors, etc., use reserved groups 200 to 254 (some of those are reserved for future
use). Group 255 is not directly accessible to a user process; this group is reserved
for overlay windows.

If a program needs more than 255 buffers then their "home" group number can
provide, it can use additional group numbers that are their home group number
plus multiples of 32, as long as the result is <200. (So process #3 could use groups
3,35,67,99,131,163; this would allow for up to 1,530 buffers for a single process).

**_Basic09 Reference_**

**GET Get a block from the window**

**Syntax: RUN GFX2([path,]"GET",group,buffer,xcor,ycor,xsize,ysize)**

**Function:** Saves a window area Get/Put buffer. Use PUT to replace the image to
the window. If you did not previously define the buffer, BASIC09 creates it. If you
store the window data in a predefined buffer, the data must be the same size or
smaller than the buffer, If not, BASIC09 truncates the data to the size of the buffer.
(Also see PUT and DEFBUFF.)

**Parameters:**

```
path The route to the window where you want to save an image.
group The group number of the Get buffer (1-199).
buffer The Get buffer number (1-255).
xcor,ycor The X- and Y-coordinates of the upper left corner of the
window image to save. The X-coordinates are in the range
0-639. The Y-coordinates are in the range 0-199.
```
```
Note: You can GET/PUT on a hardware text screen, and the X and Y
ranges on those are 0-39 or 0-79 (40 and 80 column text screen
respectively, and 0-24 on the Y range. Also, a buffer going off the
right side of the screen wraps around to the next line(s) on the left.
xsize The horizontal size of the window section to save.
ysize The vertical size of the window section to save.
```
**Examples:**

```
RUN GFX2("GET",1,5,0,0,10,15)
```
**Sample Procedure:**
This procedure draws a character, loads it into a buffer, then repeatedly replaces
the character to the window screen using PUT. Each new image erases the
previous image, giving an impression of animation.

**GPLOAD Load data into Get/Put buffer**

**Syntax: RUN GFX2("GPLOAD",group,buffer,format,xdim,ydim,size)**

**Function:** Loads a buffer with image data that PUTBLK can use for window
displays. If the Get/Put buffer is not created, BASICO9 creates it. If it is defined,
the size of the data should not be larger than the buffer. This command allows a
Get/Put buffer to be loaded from disk or created from scratch, amongst other
things.

**Parameters:**

```
group The group number you select, in the range 1-199, to let you
group buffers.
buffer A number in the range 1-255 that you assign to the buffer you
create.
format The type code of the screen format. (See Table 9-3.)
xdim The X (horizontal) dimension of the stored block.
ydim The Y (vertical) dimension of the stored block.
size The size of the buffer in bytes. A buffer size can be up to 32
kilobytes, depending on available memory.
```

**KILLBUFF Deallocate Get/Put buffer**

**Syntax: RUN GFX2("KILLBUFF",group,buffer)**

**Function:** Deallocates the indicated Get/Put buffer, returning it's memory to the
system. You select group and buffer numbers when you define a buffer or when
you load or get a window image. For more information on Get/Put buffers, see
DEFBUFF, PUT, GET, and GPLOAD.

**Parameters:**

```
group The group number of the buffer you want to deallocate, in the
range 1-199. Buffer Group Numbers 0 and 200-255 are
reserved for NitrOS-9 system use.
buffer The number of the buffer to deallocate, in the range 1-255.
If you want to kill an entire group of buffers, use buffer 0.
```
**Examples:**

```
RUN GFX2("KILLBUFF",1,5)
```
**Sample Procedure:**
This procedure draws a figure on a window screen, loads it into a buffer, then
repeatedly places it in new locations on the screen. Each new PUT erases the

**PUT Put a saved data block on the window**

**Syntax: RUN GFX2([path,]"PUT",group,buffer,xcor,ycor)**

**Function:** Places the image in the specified Get/Put buffer on the window. PUT
requires only the group and buffer numbers and the window coordinates for the
upper left corner of the image. The GET function saves the dimensions of the
block in the buffer. PUT automatically handles window format conversion;
however it should be noted that if conversion is needed (different color depth
between the buffer and the window), it greatly slows down. Clipping currently also
slows things down, except for clipping on the bottom. Hardware text windows now
allow GET/PUT as well, requiring 2 bytes per character, but they will wrap to the
next line on the right side rather than clip. It should also be noted that PUT is
heavily optimized when drawn on even byte boundaries horizontally that match the
original GET (vertical does not matter). This is every 2 pixels in a 16 color mode,
every 4 pixels in a 4 color mode, and every 8 pixels in a 2 color mode. The speed
gains can be several times faster.

**Parameters:**

```
path The route to the window where you want to place a pre-saved
image.
group The group number of the buffer in which to save the window
data. If this your own and not a system one, it is recommended
that you use your process ID (see the ID function) as the
primary group number. See GET for further details.
xcor,ycor The X- and Y-coordinates of the upper left corner of the
window position. The X-coordinates are in the range of 0-639.
The Y-coordinates are in the range 0-199. On hardware text
windows, they are 0-39 (40 column) or 0-79 (80 column) for
the X-coordinate, and 0-24 for the Y coordinate.
```
```
Note: You can GET/PUT on a hardware text screen, and the X and Y
ranges on those are 0-39 or 0-79 (40 and 80 column text screen
respectively, and 0-24 on the Y range. Also, a buffer going off the
right side of the screen wraps around to the next line(s) on the left.

**CUROFF Turn off cursor**

**Syntax RUN GFX2([path,]"CUROFF")**

**Function:** Makes the cursor invisible.

**NOTE:** Shutting off the text cursor will speed up text output slightly. On graphics
windows, it will also speed up graphics commands, as the system will not need to
remove and redraw the cursor before and after every graphics command.

**Parameters:**

```
path The route to the window in which you want to turn the cursor off.
```
**Examples:**

```
RUN GFX2("CUROFF")
```

**FONT Define font buffer**

**Syntax: RUN GFX2([path,]"FONT",group,buffer)**

**Function:** Defines a buffer from which BASIC09 gets the character font (style) for
the current screen. Use the text/cursor handling functions referenced in this section
with the font you load. When you merge the Stdfonts file in your SYS directory
with a graphics window, you have the choice of three fonts from Buffers 1, 2, and
3, located in Group 200. You can also create your own fonts. FONT works only on
graphics screen. See “Using Fonts” earlier in this chapter.

You must load the font you want to use into the defined buffer before using FONT.

**NOTE:** While the standard for fonts is that all fonts are in group 200 ($C8), it is
not mandatory. As long as the special GET/PUT buffer header for fonts is present,
other groups can be used. EOU automatically loads 49 fonts. See
/dd/sys/fontlist.txt for a list of the fonts, their descriptions and which size
characters they are.

**Parameters:**

```
path The route to the window in which you want to use an alternate
font.
group The group number of the buffer containing the font to use.
buffer The number of the buffer containing the font to use.
```
**Examples:**

```
RUN GFX2("FONT",280,2)

#### SETMOUSE - Set Mouse Parameters 9-


**_Basic09 Reference_**

**MOUSE Return mouse information**

**Syntax: RUN GFX2("MOUSE",valid,fire,x,y,[area,sx,sy])**

**Function:** Returns Mouse packet information.

**Parameters:**

```
valid 0=data not valid (not interactive window)
fire Mouse fire button status.
```
1. =no buttons down,
2. =Button A down,
3. =Button B down,
4. =Both buttons down
_X_ Scaled X coordinate (window relative)
_y_ Scaled Y coordinate (window relative)
The following 3 parameters are optional and used for menu framed windows. All 3
must be present for a menu framed window in order to use the Multi-Vue menuing
system.
_area_ Window area type if WNSET has been used to make a menu
framed window (with or without scrollbars).
1. =Inside the working area of the window
2. =Outside the working area, but in the menu region. This can be the
top menu bar, or scroll bars (if in a framed scrollbar window)
3. =Off window entirely (mouse on different device window)
_sx_ Unscaled X coordinate (full screen coordinate)
_sy_ Unscaled Y coordinate (full screen coordinate)
**NOTES:** One can use the _valid_ parameter to see if their program is the
current interactive window (has control of the keyboard, mouse and screen).
If _valid_ returns 0 (meaning it is not the current interactive window), the
program can pause and/or put itself to sleep for the remainder of the current
clock tick (or use **OnMouse** ). It can then monitor when it becomes the
interactive process again, and then unpause and resume running normally.
This can be used as an auto-pause in games if the player switches off of the
game window, for example.

**ONMOUSE Set up mouse button and key pressed signals, optionally**

**sleep until a mouse click or key press**

**Syntax: RUN GFX2("ONMOUSE",signal)**

**Function:** Sets up key and mouse button presses to send a signal to the calling
program. There are two ways that this function can be set up, depending on the
signal number requested to be sent:

Requesting a signals between 1 and 255 will let the program continue running
normally until a key or mouse button is pressed; it will then send the signal code to
the calling program. However, there is a caveat; If you are running BASIC09 itself
it will cause the program break out as if the BREAK key was hit, and the program
will not be able to trap it properly. For specific signal numbers to work, the
program must be PACK'ed first, and run through the run time package RUNB.
Used in this way, the signal coming in will trigger any ON ERROR GOTO the
program has set up, and the signal number will become the error code (ERR).
Because of this, it is recommended that one chooses a signal number that is *not* a
regular error number (either for NitrOS9/OS-9 or BASIC09), so a signal number
between 100-182 is recommended.

Requesting a signal of 0 is a special request to put the calling program to sleep
until a key or mouse button is pressed; the program will then be woken up. This
way the rest of the system gets to run full speed while waiting for the user to click
something. The program will resume execution on the line following the
ONMOUSE function. The program can then check for a mouse click (with
MOUSE) or key press (INKEY or a SS.Ready GetStat system call, and act
appropriately. This option is usually used when waiting for a user to make a menu
selection for Multi-Vue type programs, but can be used for other things as well.

**Parameters:**

```
signal 0=put program to sleep until a mouse click or key press.
1-255 =Signal sent to the calling program when a mouse button is
clicked or a key is pressed. This can only be trapped by ON
ERROR GOTO, and only when a program is PACK'ed and
running through RUNB (not BASIC09). This allows a program to
continue running doing other things without constantly manually
monitoring for a mouse click or key press.
```

```

```
**Examples:**

```
RUN GFX2("ONMOUSE",0) Put program to sleep until a key is pressed
or mouse button is clicked.
RUN GFX2("ONMOUSE",100) Set up an ERROR 100 to trigger when a
key is pressed or mouse button is clicked. (RUNB only)
```
**Sample Procedure:**
See the sample program for GETSEL.


**_Basic09 Reference_**

**SETMOUSE Set mouse parameters (see NOTE below)**

**Syntax: RUN GFX2(scanrate,timeout,autofollowflag)**

**Function:** Can set the mouse scan rate & mouse timeout, as well as turning mouse
cursor auto-follow on or off.

**Parameters:**

```
scanrate How many clock ticks (1/60th of a second) between
physical mouse reads. (3 is a nice balance of smoothness
and friendly multi-tasking, 1/20th of a second). A value of
255 indicates to leave the current setting alone.
timeout How many clock ticks (1/60th of a second) after a button
press before the mouse goes into "quiet" mode. Pressing a
mouse button starts a number of timers for both mouse
buttons (time in current state, time in last state, to keep
trick of multiple clicks). This timeout setting is how long
before the system resets the counters while waiting for
another mouse click. Once it hits this value all timers are
cleared and shut off (taking less CPU overhead) until the
next mouse click. A value of 255 indicates to leave the
current setting alone.
autofollowflag 0=Turn auto-follow mouse off,
1=turn auto-follow mouse on.
On means the operating system will handle all mouse
position and drawing on the screen automatically.
```
**Examples:**

```
RUN GFX2("SETMOUSE",3,120,0)
RUN GFX2("SETMOUSE",255,255,1)

**Data Types**

The following list shows the BASIC0S data type you can specify when defining a
variable.

```
Type Function
BOOLEAN Returns TRUE or FALSE.
BYTE Specifies that a numeric variable is to store single-byte
values.
INTEGER Specifies that a numeric variable is to store integer (two-
byte) values.
REAL Specifies that a numeric variable is to store real (five-byte)
values.
STRING Specifies that a variable is to store ASCIT characters.
```
**Types of Access for Files**

You can use the following parameters with the CREATE and OPEN commands.
Check the individual commands for information on which parameter to use with
which command.

```
Parameter Function
DIR or
[ENTER]
```
```
Lets BASIC09 access a directory-type file for reading. Do
not use with UPDATE or WRITE.
EXEC Lets BASICO9 access the current execution directory
rather than the current data directory.
READ Sets the file access mode for reading.
WRITE Sets the file access mode for writing.
UPDATE Sets the file access mode for both reading and writing.
```
